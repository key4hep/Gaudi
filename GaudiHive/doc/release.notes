 - CMake configuration changes to build Gaudi with optional externals missing

   In the last days I experimented a bit with teaching Gaudi how to build when
   only ROOT, Boost and TBB are available to it. This is the result. As far as I
   can tell the code builds in the same way as the current master branch when
   all possible externals are available. (All the ones available in a full ATLAS
   offline build at least.) And I'm also able to build the project in these
   modes:
     * On Ubuntu 16.04 with the system provided Boost and TBB versions, against
   a privately built ROOT 6 version.
     * On macOS Sierra against privately built Boost, ROOT and TBB versions.
   Both when building the project completely on its own, and when building it
   against an ATLAS externals project.
    Some notes:
     * The code uses C++14 expressions in quite a few places by now. So I raised
   the default C++ standard to C++14. This is the default in ATLAS builds since
   a while, I only saw this as an issue when building Gaudi "on its own" with a
   very minimal configuration command.
     * While the code advertises that it still has support for ROOT 5, it's not
   able to build against it since a wile. Since the updates I put in for TLS
   variables on macOS. (The macros used there are ROOT 6 only.) And this update
   makes things even worse. As the code now relies on not providing the
   definition of some classes to the dictionary generator in GaudiPython that
   are not available. (Because AIDA or XercesC is missing.) While ROOT 6 handles
   this with just a build warning, ROOT 5's genreflex treats this with an ERROR
   message. That I was unable to get rid of.
    So, extended testing is clearly necessary, the configuration code could
   definitely be fine tuned as I probably turned off the build of more source
   files than absolutely necessary, but I think we should move ahead with such a
   configuration organisation.

 - modernization of Property

   This is a major rewrite of the system of `Property` classes. Started as  the
   implementation of GAUDI-1214, it continued as a review of
   `IProperty` and `PropertyMgr`, to end up in a complete rewrite
   (and optimization) of `PropertyWithValue`.

   * Fixes GAUDI-1214
    - added missing `declareProperty` signature
    - added `PropertyHolder` (an updated `PropertyMgr`)
    - adapted all properties in Gaudi
   * improved use of `PropertyHolder`
    - use inheritance instead of composition
    - removed ~200 (duplicated) lines of code in GaudiKernel
   * optimization of Property (fixes GAUDI-1229)
    - use templates and automatic code generation to handle efficiently
      both value and reference properties
      - avoid creation of values on the heap (see GAUDI-1229)
      - removed the *owned* boolean flag
      - improved usability of properties (e.g. begin/end wrappers for
        C++11 loops, increment/decrement operators...)
      - deprecated use of C arrays as properties
    - merged features of `PropertyWithVerifier`, `SimpleProperty` and
      `SimplePropertyRef` into `PropertyWithValue`
    - deduplication of name and doc strings via

   [`boost::string_ref`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/utility/doc/html/string_ref.html)

      and a static storage  (see GAUDI-1229)
   * Fixes GAUDI-1205
   * add deprecation warnings in service accessors of `Algorithm` (@graven)
   * renamed `Property` base class to `Gaudi::Details::PropertyBase` and
   `PropertyWithValue` to `Gaudi::Property`
    - added backward compatibility type aliases (but not compatible with
      forward declarations of `class Property`, which should be replaced
      by `#include "GaudiKernel/PropertyFwd.h"`)
   * added macro `GAUDI_PROPERTY_v2` to allow easy implementation of
    backward compatible changes in derived projects (e.g. when user code
    relied on `DoubleProperty` having a verifier)
   * Fixes GAUDI-1268
    The changes are as backward compatible as much as possible (except if you
   explicitly inherit from `SimpleProperty`, or you forward declared
   `class Property`, which now are typedefs), but must be validated in the
   experiment frameworks.

 - Algorithm Execution State Service

   Introduction of AlgExecStateSvc
    All event state information removed from Algorithm base class
   (m_filterPassed, m_isExecuted) as it will cause difficulties with re-entrant
   Algorithms.
    event success/fail flag removed from EventContext
    These flags are moved to be under control of a new service, the
   AlgExecStateSvc, which keeps track of the execution state of all Algorithms,
   and the Event as a whole.
    Algorithm status kept in a new class ```AlgExecState``` which has
   ```
       bool m_filterPassed  {true};
       bool m_isExecuted    {false};
       StatusCode m_execStatus  {StatusCode::FAILURE};
   ```
    AlgExecStateSvc holds an AlgExecState for each Algorithm in each Event
   Slot, as well as an overall ```EventStatus``` for each EventSlot, which can
   be one of

   ```
     Invalid = 0,
     Success = 1,
     AlgFail = 2,
     AlgStall = 3,
     Other = 4
   ```
    Algorithms add themselves to the AlgExecStateSvc upon initialization, but
   the Service's initialization of  the data structures is deferred until the
   first time ```AlgExecStateSvc::reset()``` is called, at which point it's
   probably safe to figure out if there's a WhiteBoard, and the number of slots
   to allocate.
    The EventLoopMgr should call ```AlgExecStateSvc::reset()``` at the start of
   each event. If it's a concurrent EventLoopMgr, it should be
   ```AlgExecStateSvc::reset(EventContext)```, after the EventContext object
   has been updated to reflect the new event.
    Also added an EventContext object to the MinimalEventLoopMgr, so that
   serial/concurrent behaviour is similar.
    Concurrent queries to the AlgExecStateSvc must contain the EventContext, so
   the correct EventSlot can be determined. Serial access is via methods that
   don't have the EventContext as a parameter. For access from Algorithm base
   class (eg from setFilterPassed, isExecuted, etc), if the EventContext ptr
   (m_event_context) in the Algorithm is null, we assume we're running
   serially.

 - ThreadPoolSvc: Bugfix/barrier fix

   (from Steve Farrell) see https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/Gaudi/merge_requests/17

    This merge fixes a serious undefined behavior condition in ThreadPoolSvc
   introduced in the thread-tool-terminate merge. The boost::barrier was moved
   to a function local which could drop out of scope before workers returned
   from waiting. Now, the barrier is again a class member of the ThreadPoolSvc.
   Tests are successful. Additionally, I added a safety check in
   ThreadPoolSvc::terminateTool that returns FAILURE if the pool wasn't actually
   initialized.
    Finally, I put the ThreadPoolSvc's raw pointer class members into
   unique_ptrs for automatic deletion.
    See merge request !160

 - Thread tool termination

   This set of changes completes the work started by @leggett in
   a875c69e3ac6b1d1253e4086daea076860a95e52 on thread initialization tools. Such
   tools are invoked by the ThreadPoolSvc on each worker thread when the pool is
   initialized and can be used to setup thread-local workspaces in cases where
   necessary (e.g. for running multi-threaded Geant4).
    These commits enable the thread-termination part of those tools for
   corresponding cleanup/finalization of thread-local memory. This is done
   primarily by adding a terminatePool method to IThreadPoolSvc which is called
   at the end of ForwardSchedulerSvc::activate. The ThreadPoolSvc underwent some
   slight refactoring to support the thread-termination tasks.
    Also included in this merge request are a number of whitespace and
   indentation fixes, as well as some added class documentation in the affected
   classes.

! 2016-04-09 - Charles Leggett (commit 84020b9)

 - Isolate EventContext from Algorithm

   in order to not have re-entrant Algorithms stomp on each others'
   EventContexts, we need to isolate the EventContext from the Algorithm, and
   move it to the AlgoExecutionTask. We can then pass the EventContext
   explicitly to the tbb::task, instead of carrying it via the Algorithm, which
   would fail for re-entrant Algs. This also requires a change to the signature
   of ForwardSchedulerSvc::promoteToExecuted.
    We should also make the EventContext* of the Algorithm const, to prevent any
   modification from inside the Alg.
    See merge request !147

=============================== GaudiHive v2r0 ===============================

! 2016-03-10 - commit 02f2560

 - use StringKey for Alg name, add IAlgorithm::setIndex

   this patch does 3 things:

   - makes Algorithm::index() const (as it should have been), set the initial
   value to 0 instead of 123 (!)
   - adds a protected Algorithm::setIndex(unsigned int) method. this allows you
   to distinguish between clones. AlgResourcePool is the one who does the
   setting, and is declared as a friend to IAlgorithm
   - turns Algorithm::m_name into a StringKey (from a string), so we can hash on
   the name of Algorithms more easily (a useful ability when dealing with Alg
   clones, and trying to treat them all the same way)
