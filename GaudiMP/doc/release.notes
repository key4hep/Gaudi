================================ GaudiMP v1r8 ================================
! 2013-09-04 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified RecordOutputStream to allow an implicit value for  OutputStreamName:
   "Deferred:" + name.
   This is needed to enforce deferred write using algorithm type aliasing.

! 2013-08-30 - Marco Clemencic
 - Task #47619: Defer calls to OutputStreams in GaudiMP
   Added a class to record which streams should be triggered and a class to
   use the recorded informations to trigger the OutputStream instances:
   RecordOutputStream and ReplayOutputStream.

   To use the delayed write, one need to translate options like:

       mySeq.members.append(OutputStream('MyStream'))

   with something like:

       mySeq.members.append(RecordOutputStream('RecordMyStream',
                                               OutputStreamName='MyStream'))
       ApplicationMgr().OutputStream.append(
         ReplayOutputStream(OutputStreams=[OutputStream('MyStream')])
       )

================================ GaudiMP v1r7 ================================
! 2013-01-15 - Nathalie Rauschmayr
 - Patch #5593: Implemented late forking for GaudiMP
   Implemented late forking on the level of the worker processes. After
   Application Manager has been initialized and before the first event has been
   processed, subworkers are forked by the main worker.

================================ GaudiMP v1r6 ================================
! 2012-11-14 - Marco Clemencic

 - Fixed compilation warnings.

! 2012-07-27 - Marco Clemencic
 - Rationalized the permissions of files in the repository.

! 2012-07-25 - Nathalie Rauschmayr
 - Patch #5471: fixes to be able to run LHCb applications via GaudiParallel.
   - For Gauss:
     - GMPBase.py:
       - DoFirstEvent(): Call GetHistoNames instead of GetList (nearly the same
         except of the line "rootFID = node.address().par()")
       - GMPComponent.__init__(): Distinguish the applications
       - GetEventNumber(): In Gauss, EventNumber must be given by the Reader due
         to correctly set the random seeds
       - Initialize() of worker: Interface to EventCounter in order to modify
         the counters from outside
       - Engine() of worker: Set EventCounter which is given by the reader
   - General:
     - GMPBase.py:
       - Go(): SUCCESS/FAILURE is not a bool --> if-statement did not work
       - Terminate(): Termination won't work when one of the processes already
         died. Check existing processes
       - Engine() of writer: runTime of writer was not correct as it was
         overwritten every time
       - DoFirstEvent(): Register links in TransientEventStore (DAQ/RawEvent)
       - WAIT_SINGLE_EVENT = 60*6: In certain situations it happened that the
         waiting time for the finalization was too short
       - Engine() of worker: ItemList and optItemList have been modified. Double
         entries caused a memory leak
     - TESSerializer.cpp:
       - loadBuffer(): Find objects, which are not equal to /Event in TES, and
         read out the buffers
     - pTools.py:
       - ProcessTimeSpanFSR(): Time Span in FileRecords are not generated
         correctly (no merging). Instead of writing n times TimeSpanFSR, only
         the minimum and maximum is written
       - syncAllRolling(): In Gauss it happened often that the Reader is too
         fast and could not synchronize with the workers in the end. As the
         synchronization object is not reset the Reader waits for a long time
         until it calls processHang() and kills every process. Modifying the
         if-statement allows to reset the waiting time of the Reader
     - compareOutputFiles.py:
       - Sets-module is deprecated
       - Added functions for the comparison of FileRecords (CompareFSR(),
         GetFSRdict(), CheckFileRecords())

! 2011-06-23 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - fixed warnings from the eclipse code analysis engine.

================================ GaudiMP v1r1 ================================
! 2011-04-04 - Pere Mato
 - Fixes to work with LHCb Brunel
   1) Namespace changed from GaudiPython to GaudiMP for TESSerializer class
   2) Firing "EndEvent" incidents in Worker event loop. This was needed to
      eliminate crashes in Brunel when invalid pointer to collection of
      cluster was used in fitting algorithms.
   3) Call update() method after having de-serialize a KeyedContainer<>. This
      is needed to re-build the internal direct access container.

============================== GaudiMP v1r0 ==================================
! 2011-01-11 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed some ICC remarks.

! 2010-12-17 - Eoin Smith
  - Updated TESSerializer.h/cpp, python/GaudiPython for Multicore Execution
    TESSerializer class can now serialize/reconstruct Opaque Addresses using
    the GaudiKernel IOpaqueAddress interface.
    TESSerializer now uses a map as member variable for TClass names, to
    improve performance (initialize once, refer back on each event iteration)
    Multicore components collected in GMPBase.py ; the Reader, Worker and
    Writer.  pTools.py contains extra classes; HistoAgent, FileRecordsAgent
    for communication and consolidation of Histo and Records stores. pTools
    also contains some extra methods used by the Reader, Writer, Workers.

! 2010-12-16 - Sebastien Binet
 - Patch #4074: migrate GaudiPython.Parallel to multiprocessing
   First import
