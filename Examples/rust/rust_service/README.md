# Implement a Service in Rust
This is an extension of the example
"[Invoke a Rust function from C++ code](../invoke_rust_function/README.md)",
so we take as granted what is already explained there.

## Use case
Although it's relatively easy to implement a Gaudi service that uses functions
from Rust (see the dedicated example), it might be more practical to implement
the whole service logic in Rust.

## Implementation

### The Rust library (AKA crate)

### CMake
