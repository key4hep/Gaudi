# Examples of how to use Rust code in Gaudi

This directory contains a number of examples of integration of Rust code into Gaudi
projects.

To simplify the integration with CMake builds we use the
[Corrosion](https://corrosion-rs.github.io/corrosion) project. We make it
available here to share th set up with all subdirectories.
