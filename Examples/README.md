# Gaudi Examples

## mylee (My Little Experiment Example)
This folder contains some examples about how to use Gaudi to develop
HEP experiment applications.

We start by extending the framework with some experiment specific concepts,
like an event model and a geometry, that we can use to develop custom
applications for simulation, reconstruction and analysis.
