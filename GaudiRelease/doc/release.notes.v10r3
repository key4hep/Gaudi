================ GaudiKernel v12r3=====================================

! 20020628 Pere Mato, Sebastien Ponce
 - Improved error reporting when loading dynamic libraries
 - Changed INFO messages to DEBUG when initializing services
 - Replaced forward class declarations in Algorithm.h by including the concerned
   header files. This is to aliviate user confusion.
 - Added function format(char* fmt, ...) that can be used to format messages
   within the MsgStream class.
   Example:
   log << MSG::INFO << format("Evt: %8d Run: %8d", evt, run) << endmsg;
   Caveat: Since the unspecified argument list is used (...) the arguments can not
   be cheched for the correct type and possible conversions are not triggered.
