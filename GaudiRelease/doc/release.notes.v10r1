! 22020506 Pere Mato
 - Bug fix in AlgTool.cpp. Pointer to ToolSvc not initialized
   (Reported by O. Callot)

! 22020502 Pere Mato
 - Bug fix in base classes Service and Converter. The accessor msgsvc() shpould
   returns always a valid MessageSvc (Reported by RD Schaffer)
 - Added templated function service() in Converter base class.
 - Bug fix in Service.cpp. The finalize method access violates if called before
   initialize (Reported by Wim Lavrijsen)

================ GaudiObjDesc v4r2====================================
! 20020503 Pere Mato
- Small problem on the fragment obj2doth_header that forced the re-creation of
  all header files each time.
- Some changes in the generation of dictionaries:
  ~ In methods avoid use of static variables for complex types (one one instance available)
  ~ The same for accessor methods
  ~ The return type for relations was not correct in the MetaMethod creation

================ GaudiIntrospection v4r2==============================
! 20020503 - Pere Mato
 - changed MetaMethod class to allow its use with GaudiPython for
   calling methods of the new event model. The only package affected
   by these changes is GaudiPython itself.

================ GaudiPython v4r1=====================================
! 20020503 - Pere Mato
 - Adapted to new LHCb event model (KeyedContainers in addition to
   ObjectVectors).
 - Re-structured a bit: the IntrosObj and IntrosFunc share a single
   function to handle conversion of single and complex types to python.
