! 20011129 GaudiKernel v11

  - Many Changes for the DataStore classes re-design. It affects many classes: DataObject,
    RegistryEntry, Converter, DataSvc and Interfaces: IRegistry, IDataProviderSvc, ...
    More detailed instruction refer to:
    http://lhcb-comp.web.cern.ch/lhcb-comp/Frameworks/Gaudi/Gaudi_v9/Changes_cookbook.pdf

  - MsgStream.cpp
    Any change of the printout level from the application program
    using MsgStream::setLevel(...) is ignored by the message service.
    Update the local printout level on a by message bases and restore
    the previous printout level.

  - NTuple.h
    the function entries addItem(...) are DEPRECATED for
    Ntuple columns, which depend on an index column.
    The replacement is: addIndexedItem(...).
    This has repeatedly caused confusion for users.
    Also added doxygen information for these entries.

  - Added initialize() and finalize() methods in IAlgTool interface.
  - The base class AlgTool implemements them as dummy but allows an implementation
    of  them on specific Algorithm Tools
  - Removed the need to implement a queryInterface() in specific Algorithm tools. Instead
    use the expresion declareInterface<Ixxxx>(this) in the constructor.
  - Added releaseTool() method in IToolSvc.

  - New versions of interfaces:
    ISvcManager.h (incompatible) Added more functionality to offload ApplicationMgr
    ISvsLocator.h (compatible) Changed getServices() to const

  - Added new methods in DataSvc to be able to set the root without clearing
    the store

  - Removed CLID_Event from ClassID.h to avoid clashes with Event.h generated from
    GaudiObjDesc tools

  - Changed IInterface.h Introduced a new constructor for InterfaceID that
    uses a name (class name) instead of the interface number. A hash
    function converts the name into a number.

  - Changed SmartDataLocator.h reported by David Rousseau

  - Modified ClassID.h to include CondDB stuff
    Solved bug in DataSvc.cpp reported by Andrea Valassi

  - Removed interfaces IGiGaSvc.h and IGiGaSetUpSvc.h

  - Extend IChronoStatSvc to support retrieving the delta-time between
    start/stop pairs.

! 20011129 GaudiSvc v7

  - Removed default services being creted by ApplicationMgr
  - Allow to switch on and of printing of job options
    while reading the job options text file.
    Usage:
    #pragma print on
    #pragma print off
    off will switch printing off; on will switch it on.

  - Changed ToolSvc to make use of the new methods initialize() and finalize()
    in the IAlgTool interface modified in GaudiKernel.
  - Implement new method of IToolSvc::releaseTool()

  - Many Changes  for the DataStore classes re-design. See details in separate note

  - Removed functionality from ApplicationMgr and moved to ServiceManager
    in what concerns dealing with Services.
  - Interface ISvcManager improved and extended
  - Removed the inheritance of ApplicationMgr to (ISvcManager, IAlgManager,
    ICnvManager, IObjManager). Functionality recovered by queryInterface()
  - Removed default services being creted by ApplicationMgr

  - Implementation of ClearStore for DetectorDataSvc

! 20011129 GaudiDb v5

  - Changes to adapt to the new GaudiKernel that includes a re-design of
    the data store classes

  - Small improvements.

! ============================================================================
! 20011129 HbookCnv v11

  - Changes to adapt to the new GaudiKernel that includes a re-design of
    the data store classes

  - New job option HistogramPersistencySvc.PrintHistos to steer
    printing to standard output. Defaults to false.
  - Persistency service fails initialize if output file not defined.

  - Allow RZ directory names up to 16 characters rather than 8.
  - Delete histograms from PAW common after they were written to
    disk; saves memory space, which was a problem.

  - Fixed the bug that was eliminating the first character in the
    histogram titles.

! ============================================================================
! 20011129 GaudiPython v2

 - First version with somhow limited functionality but useful for testing
 - New package for interfacing Python using boost/python libraries


! ============================================================================

 - New package for object introspection

! ============================================================================
! 20011129 GaudiObjDesc v2

 - changed serializing functions and operator overloading
 - added serializing functions and operator overloading for serializing objects

 - relation-attribute 'ratio' renamed to 'multiplicity', possible values '1', 'M', 'm', 'N', 'n'
   fragment for cpp-file production for dictionaries changed, destination is now /dict
   classID-information added to cpp-files for passing it to the dictionary

 - many small changes: handling of arguments in selfdefined methods, concatenate class descriptions, produce
   at least one empty constructor, handling and errorhandling of class-attribute 'argList'

 - CppWriter generates an entry (classname - packagename/classname) to the 'Headerdatabase' before writing the cpp

 - Added production of non-standard constructors, destructors, warning at top of file

 - Changed production of serializers in .h-files

 - New package object description based on XML files
