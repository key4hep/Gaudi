Configuring the Exception Service
=================================

When an Algorithm throws an exception, or fails to return a
StatusCode::SUCCESS (ie returns a FAILURE or RECOVERABLE), control of
the execution is passed to the ExceptionSvc.

The ExceptionSvc allows the user to configure the behavior of the
event processing on a global and on a per-Algorithm basis, allowing
exceptions to be translated into status codes, or rethrown, or
allowing the value of the return code to be modified.


There are three alternatives:
   - SUCCESS
   - FAILURE
   - RECOVERABLE

For exception handling, two more alternatives are available:

   - RETHROW
   - DEFAULT


SUCCESS: Return code set to StatusCode::SUCCESS. Normal processing of
  the event will continue.

FAILURE: Return code set to StatusCode::FAILURE. This will cause the
  EventLoopManager to terminate processing of the event, and end the job.

RECOVERABLE: Return code set to StatusCode::RECOVERABLE. Processing of
  the event will halt, and the EvenLoopManager will jump to the next
  event. Processing of the job will continue.


For exceptions:

RETHROW: The exception will be rethrown. This will most likely cause
  the termination of the job, and a seg fault to occur.

DEFAULT: If the thrown exception is a GaudiException, then the
  Exception Service will change the return code to whatever is given
  in the GaudiException  (GaudiException.code()). If it is not a
  GaudiException, then the return code is set to StatusCode::FAILURE


jobOptions
-----------

for trapping exceptions:
 string ExceptionSvc.Catch = "_DEFAULT-BEHAVIOUR_ [ALG1=MODE  ALG2=MODE...]"

for changing return codes:
 string ExceptionSvc.Errors = "_DEFAULT-BEHAVIOUR_ [ALG1=MODE  ALG2=MODE...]"


 _DEFAULT-BEHAVIOUR_ must be one of "ALL" or "NONE". 

  ALL: catch all exceptions/errors, and rethrow/process them
  NONE: do not process any exceptions/errors, return StatusCode::FAILURE for
        exceptions, otherwise don't modify the return code

The optional list of [ALG=MODE] is a sequence of Algorithm Names, with
their associated behavior, where MODE is one of
SUCCESS/FAILURE/RECOVERABLE/RETHROW/DEFAULT. The behavior of
Algorithms listed here will override the default behavior. Examples are:

ExceptionSvc.Catch = "ALL Alg1=SUCCESS Alg2=DEFAULT"

 -> all exceptions caught and rethrown, except for Alg1 which if it
    throws and exception will be translated into a
    StatusCode::SUCCESS, and Alg2 which will return the status code
    held in the associated GaudiException.

ExceptionSvc.Catch = "NONE Alg3=RETHROW"

 -> exceptions caught and translated into StatusCode::FAILURES, except
    for Alg3, which will be rethrown

ExceptionSvc.Errors = "NONE Alg3=RECOVERABLE"

 -> no errors processed, except for Alg3 where a FAILURE will be
    translated into a RECOVERABLE

ExceptionSvc.Errors = "ALL Alg4=SUCCESS Alg5=RECOVERABLE"

 -> all RECOVERABLES (and FAILURES) caught and translated into
    FAILURES, except for Alg4 which, if it produces a FAILURE or
    RECOVERABLE, will translate into a SUCCESS, and Alg5 which will
    return a RECOVERABLE 


Default Behavior
-----------------

The default behavior is:

  ExceptionSvc.Catch = "ALL"
  ExceptionSvc.Errors = "NONE"

This means that ALL exceptions are caught and rethrown. Return codes
of Algorithms are not modified.
