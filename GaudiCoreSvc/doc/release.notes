################################################################################

============================= GaudiCoreSvc v1r3 ==============================
! 2012-11-12 - Marco Clemencic
 - Set the application return code to CorruptedInput in case of incident
   CorruptedInputFile.

! 2012-11-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixes to use the '-pedantic' option.

! 2012-10-26 - Marco Clemencic
 - Initialize the application return code to 'Success' in
   ApplicationMgr::configure() instead of EventLoopMgr::nextEvent(int), to
   avoid that error conditions (like failure to open a file) happening during
   initialization are discarded.

! 2012-10-21 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified TBBMessageSvc to use the new Gaudi::SerialTaskQueue.
 - Modified MessageSvc to separate the locking from the reportMessage
   implementation so that TBBMessageSvc can use non-locked code.

! 2012-07-26 - Benedikt Hegner
 - Fixed compilation with -std=c++0x.

! 2012-07-02 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added specialization of MessageSvc (TBBMessageSvc) that uses TBB (Intel
   Threading Building Blocks) tasks to print the messages asynchronously.

============================= GaudiCoreSvc v1r2 ==============================
! 2012-06-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration files.

! 2012-06-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation with Clang (lookup of operator<<).

============================= GaudiCoreSvc v1r1 ==============================
! 2012-02-06 - Marco Clemencic
 - minor esthetic fix

! 2012-01-26 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added protection to debug messages (reported by Marco Cattaneo).

============================= GaudiCoreSvc v1r0 ==============================
! 2012-01-25 - Marco Clemencic
 - Set non-zero return code in case of failure during finalization.
 - Modified the last messages (finalization and termination) of ApplicationMgr
   in case of failures.

! 2012-01-24 - Illya Shapoval
 - Modified ServiceManager to avoid race conditions on concurrent requests of
   services from different threads.

! 2012-01-20 - Marco Clemencic
 - Moved ToolSvc to GaudiCoreSvc because it's used by some other core services.

! 2012-01-19 - Marco Clemencic
 - Improved debug (VERBOSE) messages in DataOnDemandSvc.

! 2012-01-17 - Sasha Mazurov
 - Patch #5183: JobOptionsSvc: warnings and environment variables
   - Disable the warning "Reassignment of option".
   - Fix a bug: Environment variables aren't replaced by their values in a
     property's value.

! 2012-01-17 - Marco Clemencic
 - Improvements to DataOnDemandSvc:
   - do not load the ToolSvc if not needed
   - ensure that the tools are not released if the ToolSvc is already finalized

! 2012-01-16 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified DataOnDemandSvc to accept tools to map paths to node types
   (IDODNodeMapper) and to algorithms (IDODAlgMapper).
   Note: the mapping is cached in the usual internal structures so the
         implementation of the tools must always return the same answer for the
         same path.
 - Added a basic IDODNodeMapper and IDODAlgMapper (DODBasicMapper) implementing
   the minimal DataOnDemandSvc static mapping.

! 2011-12-15 - Sasha Mazurov
 - Patch #5176: fix problem with underscore in property names (Boost 1.48)

! 2011-12-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Make ApplicationMgr print the version of the package if no version is
   specified in the options.

! 2011-12-13 - Sasha Mazurov
 - Patch #5166: Allow "::" in property and component names.

! 2011-11-01 - Marco Clemencic
 - Moved core services out of GaudiSvc and into the new packages GaudiCoreSvc
   and GaudiCommonSvc. (patch #1816)
