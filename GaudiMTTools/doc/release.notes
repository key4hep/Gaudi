! 2016-10-27 - Gerhard Raven, Marco Clemencic (commit b111898)

 - modernization of Property

   This is a major rewrite of the system of `Property` classes. Started as  the
   implementation of GAUDI-1214, it continued as a review of
   `IProperty` and `PropertyMgr`, to end up in a complete rewrite
   (and optimization) of `PropertyWithValue`.

   * Fixes GAUDI-1214
    - added missing `declareProperty` signature
    - added `PropertyHolder` (an updated `PropertyMgr`)
    - adapted all properties in Gaudi
   * improved use of `PropertyHolder`
    - use inheritance instead of composition
    - removed ~200 (duplicated) lines of code in GaudiKernel
   * optimization of Property (fixes GAUDI-1229)
    - use templates and automatic code generation to handle efficiently
      both value and reference properties
      - avoid creation of values on the heap (see GAUDI-1229)
      - removed the *owned* boolean flag
      - improved usability of properties (e.g. begin/end wrappers for
        C++11 loops, increment/decrement operators...)
      - deprecated use of C arrays as properties
    - merged features of `PropertyWithVerifier`, `SimpleProperty` and
      `SimplePropertyRef` into `PropertyWithValue`
    - deduplication of name and doc strings via

   [`boost::string_ref`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/utility/doc/html/string_ref.html)

      and a static storage  (see GAUDI-1229)
   * Fixes GAUDI-1205
   * add deprecation warnings in service accessors of `Algorithm` (@graven)
   * renamed `Property` base class to `Gaudi::Details::PropertyBase` and
   `PropertyWithValue` to `Gaudi::Property`
    - added backward compatibility type aliases (but not compatible with
      forward declarations of `class Property`, which should be replaced
      by `#include "GaudiKernel/PropertyFwd.h"`)
   * added macro `GAUDI_PROPERTY_v2` to allow easy implementation of
    backward compatible changes in derived projects (e.g. when user code
    relied on `DoubleProperty` having a verifier)
   * Fixes GAUDI-1268
    The changes are as backward compatible as much as possible (except if you
   explicitly inherit from `SimpleProperty`, or you forward declared
   `class Property`, which now are typedefs), but must be validated in the
   experiment frameworks.

! 2016-10-24 - Marco Clemencic (commit a8d6605)

 - hidden/fixed "missing override" warnings exposed after !192

   - warnings from external headers are hidden declaring the include directories
   as `-system`
   - warnings from a couple of new files have been fixed
   - warnings in `HistogramSvc` are hidden because unavoidable (see f83c3d8e)
   - warnings related to CLHEP-136 have been hidden with a special trick (see
   0a238135)
    See merge request !205

! 2016-10-12 - Marco Clemencic (commit b5e05a1)

 - improved handling of package version in CMake configuration

   use project version if a package version is not provided
    See GAUDI-1215.
    See merge request !175

! 2016-10-01 - Marco Clemencic (commit 99b1001)

 - enable missing override warnings (gcc >= 5.1)

   Fixes GAUDI-1241
    See merge request !192

! 2016-07-25 - Marco Clemencic (commit e3d4b07)

 - remove CMT configuration and related files

   * removed CMT configuration files
   * adapted scripts not to use CMT
    Fixes GAUDI-1216 Fixes GAUDI-979
    See merge request !186

! 2016-05-18 - Sami Kama (commit 9eeef96)

 - allow build of Gaudi without LCG and fix ThreadPoolSvc

   Allow building of Gaudi with local externals.
    It also contains a fix to an issue introduced with merge request !160
   (GAUDI-1212).
    Fixes GAUDI-1211, GAUDI-1212.
    See merge request !166

! 2016-04-07 - Hadrien Grasland (commit 0a4087c)

 - Explicitly mark the destructor of GaudiParallelizer as noexcept(true)

   Fixes GAUDI-1187, Gaudi failing to build against recent releases of Intel
   TBB.
    See merge request !132

============================= GaudiMTTools v1r2 ==============================

! 2016-02-11 - commit e2c585c

 - Remove globalTimeOffset getter and GlobalTimeOffset property from GaudiCommon

   GaudiCommon adds a property GlobalTimeOffset and a corresponding getter
   globalTimeOffset to every algorithm/tool which uses GaudiCommon, regardless
   on whether this property is used.

   As there is no code anymore that actually uses globalTimeOffset, this patch
   removes this accessor and the corresponding property.

   Fixes GAUDI-1122.

   See merge request !61

============================= GaudiMTTools v1r1 ==============================

! 2016-01-12 - commit 4dbdc8e

 - fixed clang 3.7 compilation warnings

   Fixes GAUDI-1083.
 See merge request !89

! 2015-11-02 - commit 57f356c

 - Merge branch 'hive' into 'master'

   Fixes GAUDI-978.

   See merge request !65

!======================= GaudiMTTools v1r0 2012-01-27 ============================
! 2012-01-27 - Illya Shapoval
 - Requirements file is fixed: explicit Boost dependecy and linking option is added.

! 2012-01-26 - Illya Shapoval
 - GaudiParallelizer prototype is created. This is an algorithm manager similar
   to GaudiSequencer with the difference in that it runs algorithms in parallel
   for each event. Algorithms being executed in parallel have to be independent
   at this moment (i.e. no input/output data dependencies). Internally
   GaudiParallelizer uses Threadpool 0.2.5 library based on Boost to manage
   thread and task pools.
