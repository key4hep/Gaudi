 - Requirements file is fixed: explicit Boost dependecy and linking option is added.

 - GaudiParallelizer prototype is created. This is an algorithm manager similar
   to GaudiSequencer with the difference in that it runs algorithms in parallel
   for each event. Algorithms being executed in parallel have to be independent
   at this moment (i.e. no input/output data dependencies). Internally
   GaudiParallelizer uses Threadpool 0.2.5 library based on Boost to manage
   thread and task pools.
