Welcome to the Gaudi Project documentation
==========================================

Gaudi is a framework software package that is used to build data processing
applications for High-Energy Physics experiments. It contains all of the
components and interfaces to allow you to build event data processing
frameworks for your experiment.

Gaudi scales to the needs of the most demanding experiments at the LHC, but is
simple enough to get started quickly and have an application running in just
a short time.

Gaudi has been in production for the ATLAS and LHCb experiments and others
for many years and is also the framework used by the *Key4hep* common software for Future Collider studies such as FCC, CLIC/ILC and CEPC. A (non-exhaustive) list of framework users:

* LHCb Computing
* ATLAS Athena framework
* HARP Gaudino framework
* Fermi (previously GLAST)
* MINERvA
* BESIII BOSS framework
* LBNE (Long Baseline Neutrino Detector, WCD group), see also GARPI project
* Key4hep (common software for FCC, CLIC/ILC and CEPC)

Gaudi is fully open-source and licenced under the `Apache Licence 2.0 <https://gitlab.cern.ch/gaudi/Gaudi/-/blob/master/LICENSE>`_. Contributions are welcome; see the :doc:`contribution_guide` for details.
