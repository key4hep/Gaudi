Framework packages, interfaces and libraries
===============================================

Overview
-------------

    It is clearly important to decompose large software systems into
    hierarchies of smaller and more manageable entities. This
    decomposition can have important consequences for implementation
    related issues, such as compile-time and link dependencies,
    configuration management, etc. A package is the grouping of related
    components into a cohesive physical entity. A package is also the
    minimal unit of software release.

    In this chapter we describe the Gaudi package structure, and how
    these packages are implemented in libraries. We also discuss
    abstract inerfaces, which are one of the main design features of
    Gaudi

Gaudi Package Structure
----------------------------

    The Gaudi software is decomposed into the packages shown in :numref:`fig-packages`.

    .. figure:: images/Packages.png
        :name: fig-packages

        Package structure of the Gaudi software

    At the lower level we find GaudiKernel, which is the framework
    itself, and whose only dependency is on the GaudiPolicy package,
    which contains the various flags defining the CMT [CMT]_
    configuration management
    environment needed to build the Gaudi software. At the next level
    are the packages containing standard framework components (GaudiSvc,
    GaudiDb, GaudiTools, GaudiAlg, GaudiAud,GaudiIntrospection), which
    depend on the framework and on widely available foundation libraries
    such as CLHEP and HTL. These external libraries are accessed via CMT
    interface packages which use environment variables defined in the
    ExternalLibs package, which should be tailored to the software
    installation at a given site. All the above packages are grouped
    into the GaudiSys set of packages which are the minimal set required
    for a complete Gaudi installation

    The remaining packages are optional packages which can be used
    according to the specific technology choices for a given
    application. In this distribution, there are two specific
    implementations of the histogram persistency service, based on HBOOK
    (HbookCnv) and ROOT (RootHistCnv) and two implementations of the
    event data persistency service (GaudiRootDb and GaudiODBCDb) which
    understand ROOT and ODBC compliant databases respecively. There is
    also a scripting service (GaudiPython) depending on the Python
    scripting language and a data description service (GaudiObjDesc)
    based on the Xerces XML parser. Finally, at the top level we find
    the applications (GaudiExamples) which depend on GaudiSys and the
    scripting and persistency services.

Gaudi Package Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    :numref:`fig-packlay` shows the layout for Gaudi packages.

    .. figure:: images/PackageLayout.png
        :name: fig-packlay

        Layout of Gaudi software packages

    Note that the binaries directories are not in CVS, they are created
    by CMT when building a package.

Packaging Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Packaging is an important architectural issue for the Gaudi
    framework, but also for the experiment specific software packages
    based on Gaudi. Typically, experiment packages consist of:

    | · Specific event model
    | · Specific detector description
    | · Sets of algorithms (digitisation, reconstruction, etc.)

    The packaging should be such as to minimise the dependencies between
    packages, and must absolutely avoid cyclic dependencies. The
    granularity should not be too small or too big. Care should be taken
    to identify the external interfaces of packages: if the same
    interfaces are shared by many packages, they should be promoted to a
    more basic package that the others would then depend on. It is a
    good idea to discuss your packaging with the librarian and/or
    architect.

Interfaces in Gaudi
------------------------

    One of the main design choices at the architecture level in Gaudi
    was to favour abstract interfaces when building collaborations of
    various classes. This is the way we best decouple the client of a
    class from its real implementation.

    An abstract interface in C++ is a class where all the methods are
    pure virtual. We have defined some practical guidelines for defining
    interfaces. An example is shown in :numref:`lstg-exabstrint`:

    .. was 16.1

    .. code-block:: cpp
        :name: lstg-exabstrint
        :caption: Example of an abstract interface (IService)

        // $Header: $
        #ifndef GAUDIKERNEL_ISERVICE_H
        #define GAUDIKERNEL_ISERVICE_H

        // Include files
        #include "GaudiKernel/IInterface.h"
        #include <string>

        // Declaration of the interface ID. (id, major, minor)
        static const InterfaceID IID_IService(2, 1, 0);

        /* @class IService IService.h GaudiKernel/IService.h

        General service interface definition

        @author Pere Mato
        */

        class IService : virtual public IInterface {

        public:

            /// Retrieve name of the service
            virtual const std::string& name() const = 0;
            /// Retrieve ID of the Service. Not really used.
            virtual const IID& type() const = 0;
            /// Initilize Service
            virtual StatusCode initialize() = 0;
            /// Finalize Service
            virtual StatusCode finalize() = 0;
            /// Retrieve interface ID
            static const InterfaceID& interfaceID() { return IID_IService; }
        };

        #endif // GAUDIKERNEL_ISERVICE_H


    From this example we can make the following observations:

    | · Interface Naming. The name of the class has to start with capital "I" to denote that it is an interface.
    | · Derived from IInterface. We follow the convention that all interfaces should be derived from a basic interface IInterface. This interface defined 3 methods: addRef(), release() and queryInterface(). This methods allow the framework to manage the reference counting of the framework components and the possibility to obtain a different interface of a component using any interface (see :numref:`libr-quin`).
    | · Pure Abstract Methods. All the methods should be pure abstract (virtual ReturnType method(...) = 0;) With the exception of the static method interfaceID() (see later) and some inline templated methods to facilitate the use of the interface by the end-user.
    | · Interface ID. Each interface should have a unique identification (see :numref:`libr-ifid`) used by the query interface mechanism.

.. _libr-ifid:

Interface ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    We needed to introduce an interface ID for identifying interfaces
    for the queryInterface functionality. The interface ID is made of a
    numerical identifier (generated from the interface name by a hash
    function) and major and minor version numbers. The version number is
    used to decide if the interface the service provider is returning is
    compatible with the interface the client is expecting. The rules for
    deciding if the interface request is compatible are:

    | · The interface identifier is the same
    | · The major version is the same
    | · The minor version of the client is less than or equal to the one of the service provider. This allows the service provider to add functionality (incrementing minor version number) keeping old clients still compatible.

    The interface ID is defined in the same header file as the rest of
    the interface. Care should be taken of globally allocating the
    interface identifier (by giving a unique name to the constructor),
    and of modifying the version whenever a change of the interface is
    required, according to the rules. Of course changes to interfaces
    should be minimized.

    .. code-block:: cpp

        static const InterfaceID IID_Ixxx("Ixxx" /* id */, 1 /* major */, 0 /* minor */ );

        class Ixxx : public IInterface {
            // ...

        static const InterfaceID& interfaceID() { return IID_Ixxx; }

        };


    The static method Ixxx::interfaceID() is useful for the implementation of templated methods and classes using an interface as template parameter. The construct T::interfaceID() returns the interface ID of interface T.

.. _libr-quin:

Query Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The method queryInterface() is used to request a reference to an
    interface implemented by a component within the Gaudi framework.
    This method is implemented by each component class of the framework
    and allows us to navigate from one interface of a component to
    another, as shown for example in :numref:`lstg-exusequint`, where we navigate from the
    IMessageSvc interface of the message service to its IProperty
    interface, in order to discover the value of its "OutputLevel"
    property.

    .. was 16.2

    .. code-block:: cpp
        :name: lstg-exusequint
        :caption: Example usage of queryInterface to navigate between interfaces

        IMessageSvc* msgSvc();
        // ...
        IProperty* msgProp;
        msgSvc()->queryInterface( IID_IProperty, (void**)&msgProp );
        std::string dfltLevel;
        StatusCode scl = msgProp->getProperty( "OutputLevel", dfltLevel );


    The implementation of queryInterface() is usually not very visible
    since it is done in the base class from which you inherit. A typical
    implementation is shown in :numref:`lstg-eximpquint`:

    .. was 16.3

    .. code-block:: cpp
        :name: lstg-eximpquint
        :caption: Example implementation of queryInterface()

        StatusCode DataSvc::queryInterface(const InterfaceID& riid,
        void** ppvInterface) {
            if ( IID_IDataProviderSvc.versionMatch(riid) ) {
                *ppvInterface = (IDataProviderSvc*)this;
            }
            else if ( IID_IDataManagerSvc.versionMatch(riid) ) {
                *ppvInterface = (IDataManagerSvc*)this;
            } else {
                return Service::queryInterface(riid, ppvInterface);
            }
            addRef();
            return SUCCESS;
        }

    The implementation returns the corresponding interface pointer if
    there is a match between the received InterfaceID and the
    implemented one. The method versionMatch() takes into account the
    rules mentioned in :numref:`libr-ifid`.

    If the requested interface is not recognized at this level (line 9),
    the call can be forwarded to the inherited base class or possible
    sub-components of this component.

Libraries in Gaudi
-----------------------

    Two different sorts of library can be identified that are relevant
    to the framework. These are component libraries, and linker
    libraries. These libraries are used for different purposes and are
    built in different ways.

Component libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Component libraries are shared libraries that contain standard
    framework components which implement abstract interfaces. Such
    components are Algorithms, Auditors, Services, Tools or Converters.
    These libraries do not export their symbols apart from one which is
    used by the framework to discover what components are contained by
    the library. Thus component libraries should not be linked against,
    they are used purely at run-time, being loaded dynamically upon
    request, the configuration being specified by the job options file.
    Changes in the implementation of a component library do not require
    the application to be relinked.

    Component libraries contain factories for their components, and it
    is important that the factory entries are declared and loaded
    correctly. The following sections describe how this is done.

    When a component library is loaded, the framework attempts to locate
    a single entrypoint, called getFactoryEntries(). This is expected to
    declare and load the component factories from the library. Several
    macros are available to simplify the declaration and loading of the
    components via this function.

    Consider a simple package MyComponents, that declares and defines
    the MyAlgorithm class, being a subclass of Algorithm, and the
    MyService class, being a subclass of Service. Thus the package will
    contain the header and implementation files for these classes
    (MyAlgorithm.h, MyAlgorithm.cpp, MyService.h and MyService.cpp) in
    addition to whatever other files are necessary for the correct
    functioning of these components.

    In order to satisfy the requirements of a component library, two
    additional files must also be present in the package. One is used to
    declare the components, the other to load them. Because of the
    technical limitations inherent in the use of shared libraries, it is
    important that these two files remain separate, and that no attempt
    is made to combine their contents into a single file.

    The names of these files and their contents are described in the
    following sections.

Declaring Components
`````````````````````````````

    Components within the component library are declared in a file
    MyComponents\_load.cpp. By convention, the name of this file is the
    package name concatenated with \_load. The contents of this file are
    shown below:

    .. was 16.4

    .. code-block:: cpp
        :name: lstg-mycompcpp
        :caption: The MyComponents\_load.cpp file

        #include "GaudiKernel/DeclareFactoryEntries.h"

        DECLARE_FACTORY_ENTRIES( MyComponents ) { [1]
            DECLARE_ALGORITHM( MyAlgorithm ); [2]
            DECLARE_SERVICE ( MyService );
        }

    Notes:

    | 1. The argument to the DECLARE\_FACTORY\_ENTRIES statement is the name of the component library.
    | 2. Each component within the library should be declared using one of the DECLARE\_XXX statements discussed in detail in the next Section.

Component declaration statements
`````````````````````````````````````````

    The complete set of statements that are available for declaring
    components is given below. They include those that support C++
    classes in different namespaces, as well as for DataObjects or
    ContainedObjects using the generic converters.

    .. was 16.5

    .. code-block:: cpp
        :name: lstg-availcompdecl
        :caption: The available component declaration statements

        DECLARE_ALGORITHM(X)
        DECLARE_AUDITOR(X)
        DECLARE_CONVERTER(X)
        DECLARE_GENERIC_CONVERTER(X) [1]
        DECLARE_OBJECT(X)
        DECLARE_SERVICE(X)
        DECLARE_NAMESPACE_ALGORITHM(N,X) [2]
        DECLARE_NAMESPACE_AUDITOR(N,X)
        DECLARE_NAMESPACE_CONVERTER(N,X)
        DECLARE_NAMESPACE_GENERIC_CONVERTER(N,X)
        DECLARE_NAMESPACE_OBJECT(N,X)
        DECLARE_NAMESPACE_SERVICE(N,X)

    Notes:

    | 1. Declarations of the form DECLARE\_GENERIC\_CONVERTER(X) are used to declare the generic converters for DataObject and ContainedObject classes. For DataObject classes, the argument should be the class name itself (e.g. EventHeader), whereas for ContainedObject classes, the argument should be the class name concatenated with either List or Vector (e.g. CellVector) depending on whether the objects are associated with an ObjectList or ObjectVector.
    | 2. Declarations of this form are used to declare components from explicit C++ namespaces. The first argument is the namespace (e.g. Atlfast), the second is the class name (e.g. CellMaker).

Loading Components
```````````````````````````

    Components within the component library are loaded in a file
    MyComponents\_dll.cpp. By convention, the name of this file is the
    package name concatenated with \_dll. The contents of this file are
    shown below:

    .. was 16.6

    .. code-block:: cpp
        :name: lstg-mycompdllcpp
        :caption: The MyComponents\_dll.cpp file

        #include "GaudiKernel/LoadFactoryEntries.h"
        LOAD_FACTORY_ENTRIES( MyComponents ) [1]

    Notes:

    | 1. The argument of LOAD\_FACTORY\_ENTRIES is the name of the component library.

.. _libr-scar:

Specifying component libraries at run-time
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

    The fragment of the job options file that specifies the component
    library at run-time is shown below.

    .. was 16.7

    .. code-block:: cpp
        :name: lstg-selextut
        :caption: Selecting and running the desired tutorial example

        ApplicationMgr.DLLs += { "MyComponents" }; [1]

    Notes:

    | 1. This is a list property, allowing multiple such libraries to be specified in a single line.
    | 2. It is important to use the "+=" syntax to append the new component library or libraries to any that might already have been configured.

    The convention in Gaudi is that component libraries have the same
    name as the package they belong to (prefixed by "lib" on Linux).
    When trying to load a component library, the framework will look for
    it in various places following this sequence:

    | - Look for an environment variable with the name of the package, suffixed by "Shr" (e.g. ${MyComponentsShr}). If it exists, it should translate to the full name of the library, without the file type suffix (e.g. ${MyComponentsShr}="$MYSOFT/MyComponents/v1/i386\_linux22/libMyComponents" ).
    | - Try to locate the file libMyComponents.so using the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH (on Linux), or MyComponents.dll using the PATH (on Windows).

Linker libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    These are libraries containing implementation classes. For example,
    libraries containing code of a number of base classes or specific
    classes without abstract interfaces, etc. These libraries, contrary
    to the component libraries, export all the symbols and are needed
    during the linking phase in the application building. These
    libraries can be linked to the application "statically" or
    "dynamically", requiring a different file format. In the first case
    the code is added physically to the executable file. In this case,
    changes in these libraries require the application to be re-linked,
    even if these changes do not affect the interfaces. In the second
    case, the linker only adds into the executable minimal information
    required for loading the library and resolving the symbols at run
    time. Locating and loading the proper shareable library at run time
    is done exclusively using the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH for Linux and PATH
    for Windows. The convention in Gaudi is that linker libraries have
    the same name as the package, suffixed by "Lib" (and prefixed by
    "lib" on Linux, e.g. libMyComponentsLib.so).

Library strategy and dual purpose libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Because component libraries are not designed to be linked against,
    it is important to separate the functionalities of these libraries
    from linker libraries. For example, consider the case of a
    DataProvider service that provides DataObjects for clients. It is
    important that the declarations and definitions of the DataObjects
    be handled by a different shared library than that handling the
    service itself. This implies the presence of two different packages
    - one for the component library, the other for the DataObjects.
    Clients should only depend on the second of these packages.
    Obviously the package handling the component library will in general
    also depend on the second package.

    It is possible to have dual purpose libraries - ones which are
    simultaneously component and linker libraries. In general such
    libraries will contain DataObjects and ContainedObjects, together
    with their converters and associated factories. It is recommended
    that such dual purpose libraries be separated from single purpose
    component or linker libraries. Consider the case where several
    Algorithms share the use of several DataObjects (e.g. where one
    Algorithm creates them and registers them with the transient event
    store, and another Algorithm locates them), and also share the use
    of some helper classes in order to decode and manipulate the
    contents of the DataObjects. It is recommended that three different
    packages be used for this - one pure component package for the
    Algorithms, one dual-purpose for the DataObjects, and one pure
    linker package for the helper classes.

Building and linking with the libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Gaudi libraries and applications are built using CMT, but may be
    used also by experiments using other configuration management tools.

Building and linking to the Gaudi libraries with CMT
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

    Gaudi libraries and applications are built using CMT taking
    advantage of the CMT macros defined in the GaudiPolicy package. As
    an example, the CMT requirements file of the GaudiTools package is
    shown in :numref:`lstg-cmtreqgdtool`. The linker
    and component libraries are defined on lines 23 and 26 respectively - the linker
    library is defined first because it must be built ahead of the
    component library. Lines 28 and 34 set up the generic linker
    options and flags for the linker library, which are suffixed by the
    package specific flags set up by line 35. Line 31 tells CMT to generate the
    symbols needed for the component library, while line 33
    sets up the corresponding linker
    flags for the component library. Finally, line 30 updates LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH (or
    PATH on Windows) for this package. In packages with only a component
    library and no linker library, line 30 could be replaced by
    "apply\_pattern packageShr", which would create the logical name
    required to access the component library by the first of the two
    methods described in :numref:`libr-scar`.

        :name: lstg-cmtreqgdtool

        apply_pattern package_Lshlibflags
        macro_append GaudiToolsLib_shlibflags $(GaudiKernel_linkopts)

Linking FORTRAN code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Any library containing FORTRAN code (more specifically, code that
    references COMMON blocks) must be linked statically. This is because
    COMMON blocks are, by definition, static entities. When mixing C++
    code with FORTRAN, it is recommended to build separate libraries for
    the C++ and FORTRAN, and to write the code in such a way that
    communication between the C++ and FORTRAN worlds is done exclusively
    via wrappers. This makes it possible to build shareable libraries
    for the C++ code, even if it calls FORTRAN code internally.
