/** @class IDataProviderSvc IDataProviderSvc.h GaudiKernel/IDataProviderSvc.h
 *
 *  Data provider interface definition.
 *  The data provider interface allows to:
 *  <UL>
 *  <LI> Define lists of items to be loaded automatically when a new root node
 *       is assigned to the data store.
 *  <LI> Register objects from the data store. Once objects are registered
 *       with the data store the client gives up ownership.
 *  <LI> Unregister objects from the data store. Unregistering an object
 *       means to actually delete all entries hanging below, not the object
 *       itself - since the client claims back ownership. Note that this is a
 *       very delicate operation - any reference to the object will be invalid.
 *       Even worse: invalid references cannot be detected.
 *  <LI> Retrieve objects to the data store. Depending ont he
 *       availibility of the requested object in the data store the
 *       represented object will be loaded if possible.
 *  <LI> Find objects beeing present in the store without actually creating
 *       the representation if the object is not present.
 *  <LI> Create 'soft' links between objects in the transient store.
 *  <LI> Request object updates.
 *  </UL>
 *
 *- Removed call to update registry entry state in the data service
