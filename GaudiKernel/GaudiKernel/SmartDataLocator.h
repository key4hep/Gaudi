/** A small class used to access easily (and efficiently) data items
    residing in data stores.

      The class constructors take several arguments neccessary to be passed
    tyo the data services in order to automatically load objects in case
    they are not yet loaded. This is achieved through a smart pointer
    mechanism i.e. by overloading the operator->() at dereferencing time
    the the object will be requested from the store.

      The SmartDataLocator is meant to be "short living". It only makes
    sense to keep an object instance within e.g. the scope of one method.
    "long living" instances do not make sense and in the contrary
    would be harmful, because the information passed during construction
    to would be invalid and returned object pointers would actually
    point to hyperspace.

    The intrinsic functionality, wether the object will be retrieved or
    loaded from the data store is defined by the LOADER::.
