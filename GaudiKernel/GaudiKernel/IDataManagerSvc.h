    <P>The data manager interface of the service allows to:
    <UL>
    <LI> Discard sub-trees or the entire data stored.
    <LI> Initialize the top level root used for navigation.
    <LI> Access the tree information of the data store:
         Given a reference to a store object, which can be identified by
         path, pointer or reference to the registry entry, it is possible
         to retrieve the parent object and to access iterators over the
         leaf entries.
    <LI> Register addresses to the data store.
         Registered addresses contain the retrieve information for the
         underlying object.
    <LI> Unregister addresses from the data store. The object will no longer be
         accessible and loadable.
    </UL>
