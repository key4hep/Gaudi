    <P>The ntuple service interface allows to:
    <UL>
    <LI> Export the data provider's functionality.
    <LI> Extend the functionality in order
         to book abstract N tuples:
         <UL>
         <LI> Book COLUMN WISE N tuples.
         <LI> Book ROW WISE N tuples.
         <LI> Access a persistent N tuple within a file
         <LI> Save the N tuple after filling.
         <LI> Write individual records from to a N tuple.
         <LI> Read individual records from an existing N tuple.
         </UL>
         created N tuples are automatically put onto the
         N tuple data store.
    </UL>
