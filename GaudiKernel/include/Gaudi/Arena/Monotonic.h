  /** @class Monotonic
   *  @brief A fast memory arena that does not track deallocations.
   *
   *  This is a memory arena suitable for use with Gaudi::Allocators::Arena.
   *  It allocates memory from an upstream resource in blocks of geometrically
   *  increasing size and serves allocation requests from those blocks.
   *  Deallocations are not tracked, so the memory footprint of a Monotonic
   *  arena increases monotonically until either it is destroyed or its reset()
   *  method is called.
   *  All requests are served with alignment specified in the template parameter.
   *
   *  @todo Efficiently support stateful upstream allocators, probably by putting an
   *        instance of the upstream allocator in a boost::compressed_pair.
   *  @todo Use the given UpstreamAllocator to serve dynamic allocations required by
   *        boost::container::small_vector.
