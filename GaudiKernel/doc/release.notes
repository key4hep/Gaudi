   operators defined in the derived classes and in those cases the reference
   count should be set to 0 in the initialization of a new object and not
   touched by an assignment.

! 2011-07-21 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added use of 'UNLIKELY' in the destructor of StatusCode.

! 2011-07-21 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #4975: check for uncaught exceptions in StatusCode destructor
   If a StatusCode is created in some alg, and an exception is thrown before
   it's checked, when the stack is unwound it will trigger an unchecked status
   code error from the StatusCodeSvc, which can mislead people as to the true
   cause of the problem.

   existing "configureDirectAccess()" method with "update()".
   (patch #4613)

! 2011-01-14 - Markus Frank
 - Patch #4607: Do not store process id.
   ProcessDescriptor.cpp Do not locally store the process id (pid).
   This causes problems e.g. after a call to fork(), because the data
   accessed are those of the parent process, not the newly created process.

! 2011-01-11 - Marco Clemencic

     if the search for "B/a.txt" is not successful, the original PathResolver
     would traverse the search list again looking for just "a.txt"; not it is
     not the case anymore

! 2010-08-23 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified "loadConfigurableDb" to be able to find *_merged_confDb.py in any
   subdirectory of the InstallArea (needed to be able to install platform-
   independent files in the platform-specific directories, see GaudiPolicy).

   application (GaudiKernel/AppReturnCode.h).

! 2010-04-20 - Marco Clemencic
 - Removed ICC warnings and remarks.

! 2010-04-16 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #3943: Good names for StatEntity methods
   - GaudiKernel/StatEntity.h: add new names for "ugly methods"
         flag        -> sum
         flagMean    -> mean
         flagMeanErr -> meanErr
         flagRMS     -> rms
             ...
     All "flag" methods are moved into "legacy"-section.
     The old methods were OK when Counter has two fields "flag"(additive) and
     "weight" (multiplicative), but after removal of "weight" all these flag*
     methods are ugly.
 - Patch #3989: Tiny (but very important) fix for Gaudi::RangeBase_
   The patch removes the protected destructor form Gaudi::RangeBase_.

============================= GaudiKernel v27r8 ==============================

 - Fixed bug #63502: GaudiKernel/Converter.cpp don't assume converter
   is a ConverterSvc when retrieving name

! 2010-03-02 - Marco Clemencic
  - Improvements in ConfigurableUser:
    - Allow dependency between named ConfigurableUser instances.
      The entry in __used_configurables__ can be a tuple where the first element
      is the class (or class name) and the second element is the instance name.
      If the instance name is equivalent to False (None, "", etc.), the name of
      the instance is obtained through the method self._instanceName() that, by
      default, returns "<userclass>_<class>", but can be overridden.
    - Added a method to get a used instance by name: self.getUsedInstance().
  - Minor fix in Configurable: allow to instantiate it passing the name as a
    keyword argument (it was failing if the instance already existed).
  - Fixed a race condition in WatchdogThread.

! 2010-02-26 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added a simple generic class (WatchdogThread) for implementation of software
   watchdogs (in the sense of a secondary thread that periodically checks that
   an event has occurred).
   A derived class should implement (at least) the method "action()", which is
   invoked when the time-out occurs without that another thread called the
   "ping()" method of the watchdog.

! 2010-01-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed icc remark #1599: declaration hides variable
 - Fixed icc warning #858: type qualifier on return type is meaningless
 - Fixed icc warning #279: controlling expression is constant

! 2010-01-28 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed icc remark #424: extra ";" ignored
 - Fixed icc remark #111: statement is unreachable
 - Fixed icc remark #193: zero used for undefined preprocessing identifier
 - Fixed icc remark #522: function "X" redeclared "inline" after being called
 - Fixed icc remark #304: access control not specified ("private" by default)
 - Fixed icc remark #177: X declared but never referenced
 - Fixed icc remark #193: zero used for undefined preprocessing identifier X

============================= GaudiKernel v27r7 ==============================
! 2010-01-19 - Markus Frank
 - Fixed EventSelectorDataStream to fit with the changes in GaudiSvc
   (support of 'SVC=' in EventCollectionSvc) and removed references to SICB.

! 2010-01-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation on icc 11.
   - cmt/requirements:
     removed the cppflag -Wno-unused-parameter because not understood by icc
     (only for icc).
   - GaudiKernel/HashMap.h:
     modified to use the same code as gcc < 4.3 (ext/hash_map)
   - GaudiKernel/SmartDataPtr.h:
     disabled (icc only) a trick to avoid problems with hidden operator=,
     otherwise icc gives the error
       internal error: assertion failed: add_symbol_to_overload_list
   - src/Lib/Bootstrap.cpp:
     removed the method <anonymous>::ShadowEntry::operator=, never used and not
     accessible outside the translation unit, to avoid a warning.
   - src/Lib/System.cpp:
     removed the declaration "extern char **environ;" from within the method
     System::getEnv() (if on linux), because not needed and icc was trying to
     resolve it as System::environ.
   - scripts/make_patch.py:
     updated the default exclusion list.

! 2010-01-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed a bug in genconf: the third argument passed to the factory of tools was
   IService* instead of IInterface* (it works as long as the memory address is
   the same).

! 2010-01-11 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #3478: Registration for Algorithm Context Service
   Moved the registration for the context service from GaudiAlgorithm to Algorithm

   GaudiKernel/Lomont.h, src/Lib/Lomont.cpp
     *  The equality comparison of double numbers using as the metric the maximal
     *  number of Units in the Last Place (ULP).
     *  It is a slightly modified version of very efficient implementation
     *  of the initial Bruce Dawson's algorithm by Chris Lomont.
   The functions are copied from Kernel/LHCbMath package

   (using http://svn.python.org/projects/python/tags/r254/Tools/scripts/reindent.py)

! 2009-10-12 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #2978: GaudiKernel/StringKey.h
   New class Gaudi::StringKey to be used as "Efficient" key.
   Essentially it is just a string with pre-computed hash.

! 2009-10-08 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #3223: Add some more "Extended" property types to Gaudi

   "Vectors"
        Gaudi::Point3D
        Gaudi::Vector3D
        Gaudi::LorentzVector

    "SVector"
        ROOT::Math::SVector

    "BoostArrays"
        boost::arrays

    "CArray"
        C-arrays

    These properties are not available "on-default"  (why?)
    To use these properties one needs to include the corresponding files
       GaudiKernel/VectorsAsProperty.h
       GaudiKernel/SVectorAsProperty.h
       GaudiKernel/BoostArrayAsProperty.h
       GaudiKernel/CArrayAsProperty.h

    The usage is new proeprties is fairly trivial and illsutrated by
    new exampeles in GaudiExamples package:
       ExtenderProperties2,
       ArrayProperties
       BoostArrayProperties

    Attention:
      For *NOW* one needs to include these files before direct or
      indirect inclusion of  GaudiKernel/Property.h.
      The problem comes from some invalid design of "generic"
      function in GaudiKernel/ToStream.h  (mia culpa).
      I am goind to provide the redesigned version of ToStream.h,
      but it will take some time.
      For a time being one needs to take crea botu the
      inclusion of new headers

! 2009-10-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Patch #3239: Moved Parsers.icpp to the public headers directory (GaudiKernel)

! 2009-10-02 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #55292: Algorithms are never deleted
   - Fixed a problem in the reference counting of sub-algorithms.

! 2009-09-26 - Marco Clemencic
 - Reverted the changes in GaudiException while looking for a better
   solution (too many classes where relying on the internals of
   GaudiException).
   The other changes have been kept.

! 2009-09-25 - Marco Clemencic
 - Slightly modified GaudiException, MsgStream end few others to reduce the
   possibility of an exception in the middle of a catch block in case of
   std::bad_alloc (which would result in an immediate exit/abort).

! 2009-09-24 - Rob Lambert
 - Patch #3275: Patch to fix Incident consistencies
   - Change in name of FailedOutputFile -> FailOutputFile for consistency
     Incident.h

! 2009-09-15 - Rob Lambert
 - Patch #3240: Patch to allow backward compatibility of Incidents
   - Added a preprocessor define, which can be checked at compile time, and
     ensures backward-compatibility of the LHCb project.

! 2009-09-08 - Rob Lambert
 - Patch #3222: Patch to Issue incidents for Input Files
   - Details required for the documentation of output
     files in the Summary services
   - Added method to EventSelectorDataStream
     dbName, returns m_dbName, which contains the parsed dataset name
     required for the issuing of an incident
   - Added extra incident definitions to Incident.h
     BeginOutputFile BeginInputFile
     FailOutputFile FailInputFile
     EndOutputFile EndInputFile
     WroteToOutputFile

================ GaudiKernel v27r4 ====================================
! 2009-08-01 - Rob Lambert
 - Patch #3174: Added ICounterSummarySvc.
   This is a pure abstract interface to allow the persistance of
   counters in a file. This will be implimented by LHCb in the
   writing of an XMLSummary. StatEntities and Stat objects can be added.

! 2009-07-31 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified genconfuser.py to find the local configurables also when the file
   python.zip does not contain them yet.

! 2009-07-30 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed some doxygen warnings.
 - Use of the tag "no-hide-warnings" to re-enable warnings due to external
   libraries.
 - Added a generic hash function in GaudiKernel/Hash.h (not used by default) to
   allow simpler transition to the new Hash class introduced with patch #2979.

! 2009-07-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified the script genconfuser.py to accept an extra option to locate the
   locker module.
 - The scripts merge_files.py, ZipPythonDir.py and genconfuser.py can now be
   synchronized with a "global lock file" defined with the environment variable
   GAUDI_BUILD_LOCK (needed when using tbroadcast or equivalent).

! 2009-07-27 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #2979: Modified version of file GaudiKernel/Hash.h
   - _WIN32 specific part (due to non-adequate stdext::hash_map) is removed,
      since stdext::hash_map is not used anymore - GaudiUtils::HahsMap for
      _WIN32 platform is using std::map instead
   - The generic a'la Stroustrup implementation is removed (may break existing
     code)
   - For generic implementation relies on availability of hash_value function in
     a spirit of boost. Boost provides the specializations for the basic
     fundamental types as well for the standard containers
   - there is no specialization for "void*"

! 2009-07-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified genconfuser.py to explicitly avoid errors if the imported file tries
   to imports configurables that do not exist.
 - Removed the obsolete merge_genconfDb.py.

! 2009-07-20 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed a compilation warning in PropertyMgr.cpp.
 - Added '-no_static' to the declaration of the libraries (implemented since CMT
   v1r20p20081118).

! 2009-07-16 - Marco Clemencic
 - Support for zipped python directories.
   Modified loadConfigurableDb() to be able to locate the "*_merged_confDb.py"
   inside the .zip files too.

================ GaudiKernel v27r3 ====================================
! 2009-07-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Removed the need for extend_interfaces1. Then necessary typedef is added by
   the macro DeclareInterfaceID, simplifying a lot the changes. The drawback is
   that when an interface extends more than one other interface, it must use
   DeclareInterfaceIDMultiBase instead of DeclareInterfaceID.
 - Removed the usage of extend_interfaces1.

================ GaudiKernel v27r2 ====================================
! 2009-06-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Removed the special compile time flag for the dictionary (problem fixed in
   ROOT 5.22.00c)

! 2009-06-26 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #3019: std::map<std::string,std::pair<double,double> > as property
   Useful for representation of ranges or value+/-error.

! 2009-06-26 - Gerhard Raven
 - Patch from bug #52359: Allow setting of logging stream in ProcessJobOptions
   A custom output stream can now be passed to
   GaudiKernel.ProcessJobOptions.InstallRootLoggingHandler().

! 2009-06-23 - Marco Clemencic, Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #2980: Moved Range.h and NamedRange.h from GaudiUtils to GaudiKernel.

! 2009-06-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - Disable the macros for the visibility of symbols on Windows, because it is
   impossible (currently) to make coexists the gcc and VC ways.
 - Added a compile time flag for the dictionary to hide warnings.
 - Fixed some compilation problems on Win32.

! 2009-06-15 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - use the new LCG tag convention.

! 2009-05-29 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Added "define NOMINMAX" in boost_allocator.h to avoid compilation problems on
   Windows.

! 2009-05-25 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #45517: Units not taken into account in .opts files
   Added the function importUnits() to populate from python the units used in a
   .opts file.

! 2009-05-20 - Yushu Yao
 - Patch #2975: ServiceHandleArray
   Added ServiceHandleArray, similar to ToolHandleArray, but for services.

================ GaudiKernel v27r1 ====================================
! 2009-05-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #50389: AppMgr.algorithm/tool/algorithms does not work for
                     GaudiPython::PyAlg<TYPE>
   Changed the inheritance from "implements#": replaced "virtual public" with
   "public" (more correct and does not confuse PyROOT).

! 2009-05-14 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed an extra "release" of EventDataSvc in EventSelectorDataStream.
   At each new file, the reference count was artificially decreased by 1,
   causing a segmentation fault during finalization.

! 2009-05-13 - Eric Van Herwijnen
 - Patch #2998: Extension of IMonitorSvc for StatEntity
   Added a declareInfo method for StatEntity instances.

! 2009-05-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added backward compatibility hack in SmartIF: SmartIF::pRef.
   Can be disabled with the macros GAUDI_V22_API and NEW_SMARTIF.
 - Added a temporary hack to allow the print out of a SmartIF instance.

! 2009-05-06 - Marco Clemencic
 - Simplified the implementation of SmartIF, removing the unnecessary base
   class. It requires some more code duplication in the implementation of
   SmartIF<IInterface>.
   Part of the simplification comes from auto_ptr and the Boost smart pointers.
   Note: NOT backward compatible.

! 2009-04-27 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added specific macros to disable specific backward compatibility hacks.
   The hacks are all enabled with the preprocessor macro GAUDI_V20_COMPAT,
   and they are all disabled if the macro is not defined.
   Each of them can be disabled independently of the others using the
   following macros (enabled with the same CMTEXTRATAG):
   - G21_NEW_INTERFACES: new interfaces and interfaces ids
   - G21_HIDE_SYMBOLS: enable symbol visibility control
   - G21_NO_ENDREQ: remove the obsolete endreq
   Some hacks are disabled by the macro GAUDI_V22_API and can be independently
   disabled with the macros:
   - G22_NEW_SVCLOCATOR: backward incompatible changes to ISvcLocator etc.
   Obsolete/deprecated methods and functions (kept with GAUDI_V20_COMPAT)
   can be removed with the macros G21_NO_DEPRECATED and G22_NO_DEPRECATED.

================ GaudiKernel v27r0 ====================================
! 2009-04-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #47258: gaudirun.py -o option.opts option.py introduces
                     explicit \n and \t in strings

! 2009-04-08 - Marco Clemencic, Vanya Belyaev
 - Fixed bug #48401: No dictionaries for IStatSvc and IChronoSvc

! 2009-04-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Moved back the namespace MSG to the global namespace.

! 2009-04-06 - Charles Leggett
 - Fixed bug #48889: Copy and paste errors in MinimalEventLoopMgr

! 2009-04-06 - Marco Clemencic
 - Renamed back the namespace Msg to MSG and moved it into the namespace Gaudi.
   The backward compatibility is obtained with a namespace alias, that is
   enabled with GAUDI_V20_COMPAT and can be selectively disabled with the macro
   NO_OLD_MSG_NAMESPACE.
 - Renamed back INamed to INamedInterface.

! 2009-04-02 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #2867: Propagate finalize errors of sub-algorithms.
 - Patch #2871: Propagate errors in Property callbacks.
   Changed the return value of Property::useUpdateHandler() and added a
   try-catch to trap exceptions and return a failure in that case.

! 2009-03-18 - Marco Clemencic
 - Minor change in Service::service<T> to avoid a problem with an old gccxml
   (ROOT 5.18).

! 2009-03-13 - Marco Clemencic
 - Task #9061: Introduction of component managers
   - Added the IComponentManager interface to allow a common and generic
     handling of managers. A basic implementation is provided too
     (currently used only by ServiceManager and AlgorithmManager)
     The FSM transitions are accessed through the IStateful interface, instead
     of specific methods like initializeServices or finalizeAlgorithms.
 - Simplified the interfaces ISvcLocator, ISvcManager, IAlgManager reducing
   the methods. The new format is enabled with the cpp macro GAUDI_V22_API.
   The main function now returns a SmartIF instead of a StatusCode.
 - Added a templated base class (CommonMessaging) to instrument classes with
   common messaging functionalities: msgSvc(), caching of the message stream,
   info(), etc.
 - Disabled the constructor of InterfaceID from a long (conditional to
   GAUDI_V20_COMPAT). The result was not correct.
 - Removed "void** operator& ()" from SmartIF because prevents the creation of
   std::list<SmartIF<T> >.
 - Replaced the small class "ListItem" with a more explicit "TypeNameString"
   with the same implementation.
 - Code adapted to the changes in the API.

! 2009-03-05 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added a macro to disable the longlong typedef: NO_LONGLONG_TYPEDEF.

! 2009-02-19 - Marco Clemencic
 - Patch #2790: Rename the namespace MSG to Msg

! 2009-02-06 - Marco Clemencic
 - Moved the implementation of the methods addRef and release to the templated
   base class implements<> (avoids duplication).
 - Modified implements.h to use preprocessor macros instead of replicated code.
 - Fixed a problem with MinimalEventLoopMgr::executeEvent. An AbortEvent
   incident fired by the last top alg in the list caused the skipping of the
   following event.

! 2009-01-30 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation warnings when using Boost 1.38 (Spirit changed includes).
 - Replaced all the occurrences of endreq with endmsg. Removed endreq and added
   a macro endreq for backward compatibility (enabled with -DGAUDI_V20_COMPAT).

! 2009-01-29 - Marco Clemencic, Sebastien Binet
 - Symbol visibility (includes patch #2641)
   Added the preprocessor macros GAUDI_API, GAUDI_EXPORT, GAUDI_IMPORT and
   GAUDI_LOCAL to allow the decoration of classes and functions with visibility
   attributes.
   Decorated all the classes and functions that needs to be exported. This means
   essentially:
     - classes with at least one method in a .cpp file
     - abstract/virtual classes (to have the virtual destructor only in one
       place, to allow a correct dynamic_cast)
     - non-inline functions (i.e. implemented in .cpp)
     - all the classes that are part of an hierarchy that has to be navigated
       with dynamic_cast
   Usually it is not needed to decorate the fully-inlined classes/functions and
   the templated ones (unless they are using globals or are not completely
   implemented in the .h).
   In some cases it is enough to decorate only the non-inline methods of a
   class, mainly if the ratio non-inline/inline is small.

! 2009-01-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Restored the special implementation of queryInterface for PropertyMgr.

! 2009-01-23 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixes
   - added Boost_linkopts_date_time to avoid a compilation problem on win32
     with the LCGCMT 56 candidate (Boost 1.37)
   - removed fake declaration of mpl_::na (Boost) used for GCCXML
   - constantness problems in the new code discovered by gcc 4.3
   - warning about non specified base class in a copy constructor

! 2009-01-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - Introduced Boost Meta Programming Library (MPL) code to allow automatic
   generation of queryInterface methods.
   - modified IInterface to provide the needed basic typedefs
   - added the class Gaudi::InterfaceId to collect the list of interfaces
     implemented
   - added the templated classes extend_interfaces#, implements#, extends#
     - extend_interfaces#: used to write interfaces that inherits from other
                           interfaces (IInterface too)
     - implements#       : used to write concrete classes based on interfaces
                           only
     - extends#          : used to write concrete classes that extend concrete
                           classes with other interfaces (the constructor of the
                           base class must be called via the base_class typedef)
     if these classes are used, the method queryInterface is generated
     automatically.
   - added the preprocessor macro DeclareInterfaceID to declare the interface id
     for the interface; it must be put in the public section of the interface
     declaration using the interface as first argument, then major and minor
     versions:

       class IMyFunctionality: virtual public extendInterfaces1<IInterface> {
       public:
         DeclareIterfaceID(IMyFunctionality,1,0);
       };

   - modified the interfaces to use the new functionalities
   - NOTE: An updated interfaces does not require changes in the concrete
           implementations if GAUDI_V20_COMPAT is enabled. On the other hand, an
           adapted concrete class requires that all its interfaces are adapted.
   - added the (automatically generated) method IInterface::getInterfaceNames
     which returns a vector with the names of the interfaces implemented by the
     component
   - all the IID_* constants had to be removed to avoid conflicts with the IDs
     generated with DeclareIterfaceID (note that they are not needed even in
     v20-compatible code)
 - Renamed INamedInterface to INamed. The old header and a typedef are provided
   for backward compatibility (only if the macro GAUDI_V20_COMPAT is used).
 - Removed the obsolete ITime.h, TimePoint.h and Algorithm.icc.

================ GaudiKernel v26r1 ====================================
! 2008-12-16 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified the Configurable.getValuedProperties logic to use all the explicitly
   set properties and not only those different from the defaults.

! 2008-12-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added the possibility of declaring "passive" dependencies between
   ConfigurableUser instances (i.e. C.U.s from which the properties are taken).
   The dependency is declared with the class data member
   __queried_configurables__.
 - Modified Python logging formatter of configurables to add the prefix ("#") to
   each printed line.

! 2008-12-10 - Marcus Frank
 - Patch #2699: First version of run records service
   Generalize DataIncident to also pass arbitrary parameters.

! 2008-12-09 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed minor problem in Configurable.__new__ for ConfigurableUser.

! 2008-12-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation warning with gcc 4.3.

! 2008-12-05 - Marco Clemencic
 - Improved the logic of ConfigurableUser.propagateProperty (see the code for
   details).

! 2008-12-01 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #44504. Inconsistent default for createIf flag for services.
   Set the default of the flag to "true" in both IServiceLocator::service
   signatures.
 - Fixed bug #44279. Ambiguous signature in setProperty functions
   Removed the redundant declarations.
 - Fixed problems with ToolHandles.

! 2008-11-27 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation problems with ROOT 5.21/06.

================ GaudiKernel v26r0 ====================================
! 2008-11-13 - Pere Mato
 - Added the functions pushCurrentDataObject and popCurrentDataObject, taken
   from GaudiPoolDb.

! 2008-11-12 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added the possibility of specifying post-config actions (functions to be
   called after the call of all __apply_configuration__ methods) with the
   functions appendPostConfigAction and removePostConfigAction from
   GaudiKernel.Configurable (exposed via Gaudi.Configuration too).

! 2008-11-11 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added a small script (make_patch.py) to simplify the generation of patches.

! 2008-11-10 - Marco Clemencic
 - Minor change to ISvcManager to allow enable/disable of the initialization
   loop check.

! 2008-11-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added automatic registration of ConfigurableUser specializations to the
   database of configurables.

! 2008-11-06 - Marco Clemencic
 - Re-enabled the GaudiHandleProprtyProxy.
 - Modified the ConfigurableUser base class so that the ConfigurableUser classes
   declared as used are not active by default and they get activated the when
   they get instantiated explicitly. The test has been updated too.

! 2008-11-01 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #43420. IPartPropSvc not accessible from Python
   Added the missing interface to the dictionary.

! 2008-10-30 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed a compilation problem on gcc4.3 with properties of type vector<pair>.
   (order of specializations in GaudiKernel/ToStream.h)
 - Replaced operator<<(MsgStream,vector) with the one in GaudiKernel/SerializeSTL.h
 - Modified the base class ConfigurableUser to allow automatic apply. If the
   ConfigurableUser derived class should touch other ConfigurableUser instances,
   the classes must be added to the class data member __used_configurables__
   (see tests/scripts/test_configurable_users.py in the package Gaudi).
 - Added the function GaudiKernel.Configurable.applyConfigurableUsers() which
   actually does the job of calling the apply method of all the ConfigurableUser
   instances.
 - Added the methods getProp and setProp to Configurable (LHCb contibution) and
   propagateProperty and propagateProperties to ConfigurableUsers (adaptations from
   LHCb contributions).

! 2008-10-28 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #43314. Memory leak in StatusCode
   Added protection against self-assignment and delete of the owned
   IssueSeverity instance.

! 2008-10-27 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed warnings reported by gcc 4.3:
   - type qualifiers ignored on function return type
   - ../src/Lib/StatusCode.cpp:59: warning: the address of ‘addresses’ will
     always evaluate as ‘true’
   - ISO C++ forbids casting between pointer-to-function and pointer-to-object
     (only active for gcc >= 4)
 - Modified ConfigurableAlgTool.toStringProperty to use getFullName (to get rid
   of the parent name in front of the instance name).
 - Fixed a glitch in Configurable.__str__ when the property is a GaudiHandle.
 - Do not use the full path to genconf.exe with install area.
 - Fixed compilation errors and some warnings on gcc 4.3.

! 2008-10-23 - Marco Clemencic
 - Reverted old implementation of the reinitialize method of Algorithm, Service
   and AlgTool, i.e. do nothing. Fixes bug #39706.
 - Fixed bug #42428. Properties of clones are not cloned.
   - Modified the method clone to create copies of the properties if they are of
     types: [ str, list, dict, tuple ].
 - Fixed bug #43065. Error when unpickling GaudiHandles.
   - Modified the constructor of GaudiHandle to accept a GaudiHandle (or any
     instance with the method "toStringProperty") as argument.

! 2008-10-21 - Marco Clemencic
 - Improvements in the logging of GaudiKernel.ProcessJobOptions. "Print OFF" and
   "print ON" can be obtained using the GaudiKernel.ProcessJobOptions.PrintOn and
   GaudiKernel.ProcessJobOptions.PrintOff functions.

! 2008-10-20 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed the cast of errno from "int" to "unsigned long". (Fixes bug #25460)

! 2008-10-17 - Sebastien Binet
 - Fixed bug #42005. System::typeinfoName is missing 'signed char'
   - Added the missing case.

! 2008-10-17 - Marco Clemencic
 - Patch #2303. Improve/extend IAlgorithm interface
   Added the methods
    - setExecuted
    - isEnabled
    - filterPassed
    - setFilterPassed
 - Fixed bug #39846. gaudirun.py creates invalid entries in flattened options
   Modified filter "getNeededConfigurables" (GaudiKernel.Proxy.Configurable) to
   exclude ConfigurableUser instances.

! 2008-10-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Excluded a couple of problematic methods from the dictionary (not preseent with
   ROOT 5.18, but causing problems with ROOT 5.21).
 - Fixed a problem with patch #2261. The usage of "id" for the aliases was
   conflicting with its usage for the DataObject factories.

! 2008-10-10 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #2073: SharedObjectsContainer and 'blind' access to TYPE::Container &
                TYPE::Selection
   Added SharedObjectsContainer.

! 2008-10-09 - Pere Mato
 - Patch #2261. Introducing name alias for Algorithms and Services
   Added the new macros DECLARE_NAMED_ALGORITHM_FACTORY(type,name) to be used
   instead of the current DECLARE_ALGORITHM_FACTORY(type) for algorithms with
   templates. Similarly for Services.

! 2008-10-09 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified the return type of the "size" methods of ObjectContainerBase,
   KeyedContainer, ObjectList and ObjectVector to be size_t (i.e. "unsigned long")
   instead of long.
   It avoids some compilation warnings.

! 2008-10-09 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #2058. Extensions for AIDA::TProfile1D
   IHistogramSvc : few new methods are added for booking of 1D-profiles with
                   Y-range and options

! 2008-10-03 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added ITHistSvc::getGraphs(), needed by patch #1963.

! 2008-10-01 - Marco Clemencic
 - Minor change in System::backTrace interface.

! 2008-10-01 - Frank Winklmeier
 - Patch #1797: Backtrace utility for System
   Generalized version of the code taken from IssueLogger::getTraceBack()
   (GaudiSvc).
 - Patch #1796: Performance improvement for message reporting

! 2008-08-06 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #39809 (wrong configuration of public tools).

! 2008-08-05 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #39250. Cannot use configurable instances as values for properties
                     of type map<str,str>.
 - Fixed bug #39117. gaudirun.py export to old options does not handle correctly
                     GaudiHandles.
   Added the method getFullName.
 - Fixed bug #39116. gaudirun.py export to old options prints '#' instead of '//'
   The fix required a review of the way messages are printed across the whole
   Configurables machinery. The Python standard logging module is now used and
   the customization in GaudiKernel.Logging has been removed.
   In printout in Python job option files should be done with the log instance
   accessible from Gaudi.Configuration.

                     reference.
 - Fixed bug #38194: gaudirun.py expands too many environment variables
   Avoid to expand the environment variables in the strings.

================ GaudiKernel v25r0 ====================================
! 2008-06-12 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified the logic behind IFileAccess: the implementation must be able to
   tell which protocols it can handle.

! 2008-06-10 - Charles Leggett, Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #37690. message svc release() in Auditor destructor
   - Moved the call the message service release to the finalize method, where it

   - Gaudi::Sleep(int)
   - Gaudi::NanoSleep(long long)

! 2008-06-06 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed Windows compilation warning (caused by patch #1756).

! 2008-06-05 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #36742. Cannot pickle options using "PropertyReference"
 - Fixed a problem on osx105 (Undefined symbols: _environ).
 - Fixed bug #37479. gaudirun.py fails parsing old option lines with comments
                     and quotes.
 - Fixed bug #37488. importOptions does not expand environment variables.

   - Fixed avoiding that tuples and lists are treated the same way.
 - Fixed bug #34769. Assigning a configurable to a list property does not fail.
   - Values for properties expecting lists, tuples and dictionaries must match
     the type (before it was possible to set a list from an iterable object).
 - Fixed handling of files starting with '#!' in gaudirun.py

! 2008-06-04 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed the last place where dylib was used on OSX (DsoUtils.h).

! 2008-06-04 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #1865. Better printouts for HistorySvc.
   - Prints out more information about the various History objects to the output
     file.

! 2008-06-02 - Marco Clemencic
 - Task #5809. Extension to Gaudi Application state machine.
   First implementation of the proposed extension.
   A new interface (IStateful) has been added to provide a common way of
   interacting with the state machine.
   The interfaces IService, IAlgorithm and IAlgTool have been extended with the
   methods from IStateful, and ISvcManager and IAlgManager have been extended to
   support the new states.
   The states and the transition have been defined in enums
   (Gaud::StateMachine::State, Gaudi::StateMachine::Transition), and the
   constraints on the possible changes are enforced by the function
   Gaudi::StateMachine::ChangeState, which throws an exception if the transition
   is not allowed.
   Since algorithms and tools do not support all the states, the state
   Gaudi::StateMachine::CONFIGURED is reached after the constructor. Services
   are constructed in the state Gaudi::StateMachine::OFFLINE and become
   Gaudi::StateMachine::CONFIGURED in the base class initialize method (as
   defined in patch #1757).
   The methods Algorithm::setInitialized and Algorithm::setFinalized has been
   removed.
   IAuditor has been extended to support auditing of the new transitions (start
   and stop).
   The Reflex dictionary has been updated to include the new classes/enums.

! 2008-05-29 - Charles Leggett
 - Changed the name of the extension for libraries on OSX from ".dylib" to ".so".

! 2008-05-13 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #1756. Improvements for Chrono/ChronoStat&IChronoSvc
   - Removal of many (ugly) obsolete lines, overall cleanup, improved flexible
     print-out and other improvements.
   - GaudiKernel/IChronoSvc.h
     - The basic type from IChronoSvc now is "double" instead of "longlong".
     - Change the return type from void to "(const)StatEntity*" for the methods
       chronoStart/Stop.
   - GaudiKernel/ChronoEntity.h, src/Lib/ChronoEntity.cpp
     - The class is essentially rewritten (keeping the same public interface) in
       terms of the generic counter StatEntity. And internally it is just a set
       of three generic counters (for user/kernel&elapsed time correspondingly).
       New features includes the better control over the printout through new
       methods: outputUserTime, outputSystemTime, outputElapsedTime, outputTime.
   - GaudiKernel/Chrono.h
     - Make this tiny helper class simpler and more efficient:
       - for the usage with IChronoSvc, avoid one virtual call
       - allow the usage with ChronoEntity class

! 2008-05-09 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added small interface (IFileAccess) for services/tools that allow read-only
   file access agnostic of the storage backend (filesystem, web, CondDB, ...).
 - Fixed a minor problem in ProcessJobOptions.py strip away spaces in component
   and property names ("MyAlg . MyProp" -> "MyAlg.MyProp").

================ GaudiKernel v24r0 ====================================
! 2008-04-04 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - Patch #1751. Fixed a typo in Stat::operator-=.

! 2008-04-04 - Marco Clemencic
 - Bug #35201. Python options parser '//' interpreted as comment in strings.
   Fixed by adding an extra check in ProcessJobOptions.py to allow '//' in
   strings (like URLs). The fix is not perfect because requires that the string
   is on a single line, but at least allows it.
 - Fixed Bug #34680. Bad implementation of Service::messageSvc.
   The obsolete methods now forward the call to the correct ones.
   (anyway they should be removed at some point)
 - Fixed a problem introduced with patch #1757.
   Modified DataStreamTool to call sysInitialize instead of initialize for
   conversion services.

! 2008-04-04 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #1757. detect creation/initialization loops for services.
   Modified the way the state of the service is set:
    - the base class initialize sets the state to CONFIGURED
    - the service becomes INITIALIZED in the sysInitialized, after the
      specialized service completed (successfully) the initialization.

! 2008-04-03 - Sebastien Binet / Martin Woudstra
 - Bug #34752/Patch #1747. GaudiHandleArray.__getstate__ prevents pickling.
   Fixed.

! 2008-04-03 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - Patch #1751.
   Change the signature of declareProperty/declareRemoteProperty methods
    - for PropertyMgr form "void" to "Property*"
    - for Algorithm/Service/AlgTool/Auditor base classes from StatusCode to
      "Property*"

   The previous return value was completely useless:
    - either "void" or (always) StatusCode::SUCCESS

   With the pointer to the actual property returned, one can easily use it, e.g.
   to declare handlers as in:
   //----------------------------------------------------------------------
   class MyAlg : public Algorithm
   {

   public:

     // constructor

     MyAlg ( ... ): Algorithm ( ... )
                  , m_property( .... )
     {
       declareProperty ("Property" , m_property , "some documentation")
         -> declareUpdateHandler ( &MyAlg::handler ) ;
     }

   private:

     SOMETYPE m_property;

   };
   //----------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2008-04-03 - Marco Clemencic
 - Patch #1725. New IAuditor interface.
   - The Auditor member functions are now only 8, for all the combinations of:
     * before or after
     * standard event or custom event
     * INamedInterface* or string
   - All the after methods accept a StatusCode (if not specified, a SUCCESS with
     the checked flag set is used).
   - The obsolete member functions are kept for backward compatibility.
   - The default implementations of "before" and "after" are using the obsolete
     methods to make legacy Auditors to work.
   - IAuditorSvc is now an extension of IAuditor.
   - AuditorGuard has been adapted to the new interface and the audit with a
     status code check is simpler.
   - The standard event types defined in the enum IAuditor::StandardEventType
     can be printed and converted to strings with operator<<.

! 2008-04-02 - Marco Clemencic
 - Python job options:
   - Removed the possibility of assigning a tool to an attribute of a
     configurable if that attribute/property does not exists. It was intended to
     allow simple declaration of private tools, but it is dangerous because it
     avoids the checking of the spelling of properties.
   - Modified Configurable.addTool() to accept a subclass of ConfigurableAlgTool
     as first argument (as well as an instance) to avoid the instantiation of an
     unneeded instance of the public tool configurable.

! 2008-03-11 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - added 2 patterns to create and use helper library for genconf. Some libraries
   need to have other preloaded libraries in order to perform the genconf
   procedure correctly. While this can be fixed on linux with the
   LD_PRELOAD environment variable, this is not possible on windows. Thus
   the genconf executable takes an extra argument "--load-library" to which
   the full path of the helper library is passed.

! 2008-03-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added a work around for ROOT bug #34282 in dict/dictionary.xml (excluded few
   data members of Gaudi::Time).
 - Fixed Bug #34046. False warning when mixing Python options and old options.
   The check on the case of old options have been improved.

================ GaudiKernel v23r4 ====================================
! 2008-02-28 - Marco Clemencic
 - Minor change to fix a regression. The line

     #include"file.opts"

   is understood by the JobOptsSvc, but it was not by the Python parser.

! 2008-02-27 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #1711. Get all instances of a tool type.
   Function used in the Atlas event display.

! 2008-02-27 - Marco Clemencic
 - Hack to avoid a conflict in the way Configurables are used in Athena and
   Gaudi.  In GaudiPython they are used in the AppMgr constructor, while in
   Athena they are used in a different moment (and not even all of them are
   needed).
   The conflict is resolved by using a function to return the needed
   configurables, implemented to return the keys of allConfigurables for Gaudi
   and and empty list for Athena.

! 2008-02-27 - Wim Lavrijsen
 - Patch #1710. Convenience method for removing entries from GaudiHandleArray
   Add a simple convenience method for deleting tools from a ToolHandleArray by
   name, rather than having to locate them first.

! 2008-02-21 - Marco Clemencic
 - Moved the release of m_messageSvc and m_pAuditorSvc from Service::~Service to
   Service::sysFinalize.

! 2008-02-21 - Yushu Yao
 - Patch #1687. Adding getPropertyMgr() in AlgTool
   This is needed to develop double use tools (tools that can be used in Gaudi
   as well as in ROOT) in Athena.

! 2008-02-20 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - added static function to Message.{h,cpp} in order to be able to access
   Message::DEFAULT_FORMAT and Message::DEFAULT_TIME_FORMAT.

! 2008-02-04 - Charles Leggett
 - Patch #1668.
   In Python 2.5, the method __str__ of ServiceHandles gets called causing some
   problems. The reason has to be investigated, but the patch allows to work.

! 2008-02-04 - Yushu Yao
 - Patch #1666: Add AlgTool::declareRemoteProperty
   Added the member function declareRemoteProperty to AlgTool (present in
   Algorithm and Service).

! 2008-02-04 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #33209: Deprecated raising a string with Python 2.5
   Added a class for errors occurring during the parsing (ParserError).

! 2008-01-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Python options:
   Modified added a flag to the Configurable base class to block assignments.
   The flag is set in GaudiPython.AppMgr after the application manager has been
   configured, to prevent that people try to manipulate the configuration when
   it is too late.
   The lock does not (and cannot) work for in-place changes (like += on a list).

! 2008-01-29 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - Modified IInterface::hash32 to use and return "unsigned int" instead of
   "unsigned long" for portability.

================ GaudiKernel v23r3 ====================================
! 2008-01-18 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed bug #32549.
   Changed the level of the message about the AbortEvent incident from ERROR to
   DEBUG.
 - Fixed a compilation warning in genconf.cpp with Boost 1.34.1 on Win32.

! 2008-01-14 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - Patch #1581.
   - GaudiKernel/Parsers.h, src/Lib/ParseMaps.cpp
      add the parser functions for parsion of following types:
      1) std::map<int,std::string>
      2) std::map<unsigned int, std::string>
    These types play important roles for LHCb-HLT and are requested
      by Gerhard Raven

! 2008-01-11 - Gerhard Raven
 - patch #1621 (bug #32466).
   Add to IToolSvc/ToolSvc the possibility of using observers to monitor the
   creation of and retrieval of tools.

! 2008-01-11 - Marco Clemencic
 - Python options:
   - Modified Configurable.addTool to set the property with the same name of the
     tool (if it exists), so that it not hides the tool reference.
   - Modified PropertyProxy.__get__ to allow direct access to the default for
     dictionaries as well as for lists.
   - Added the helper class Configurable.PropertyReference to allow the late
     binding of properties as it was possible in old options (mainly needed for
     backward compatibility).
     The option:

        MyAlg.MyProp = @AnotherAlg.AProp;

     translates to:

        MyAlg().MyProp = Configurable.PropertyReference("AnotherAlg.AProp")

   - Modified the parser of old job options to correctly translate references.
   - Modified ConfigurableAlgTool.getFullName to return only the instance name
     (instead of the fully qualified name).
   - Allow the wrong case for properties in old option files, but issue warnings.
   - Modified the default logger to print "GaudiKernel" instead of "Athena" and
     prepend a '#' to the message to allow evaluation of the standard output in
     Python (needed in Ganga).

! 2008-01-10 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed a problem in ProcessJobOptions.py occurring when option values have '\'
   inside (filenames on Windows).

! 2008-01-09 - Marco Clemencic
 - Python options:
   - Take the values for VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, FATAL always from
     GaudiKernel.Constants.
   - Made "Configurable" equivalent to "str", so that it is possible to set a
     string property from a configurable instance.  It allows something like:

       mySvc = AService("theService",...)
       myAlg = AnAlgorithm("theAlgorithm")
       myAlg.ServiceToUse = mySvc

! 2008-01-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed a problem in ProcessJoboptions.py: allow have white spaces before the
   '#' sign of directives.

! 2007-12-20 - Marco Clemencic
 - Improved the message of DataSvc when re-throwing a std::exception. Now the
   message contains the type of the exception.
 - Added a constructor for GaudiException accepting a std::exception. The type
   of the passed exception and its message are appended to the message of the
   GaudiException.
 - Fixed a problem in ProcessJoboptions.py when DOS new-lines were found on
   Unix.

! 2007-12-19 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed a couple of typos in Map.h (preventing the generation of dictionary).
 - Check if a value is in the list before trying to delete it when interpreting
   "-=" in old job options.
 - Restored the original logic for parsing list in old job options (replace all
   "{}" with "[]", unless there is a ':').

! 2007-12-12 - Marco Clemencic
 - patch #1585.
   - Added the templated function pp_cast<DEST>(SRC**) to replace the common casts
       (void**)&pointer
     and
       (IInterface *&)m_mySvc
     to avoid the warning
       "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules"
   - Fixed warnings about breaking of strict-aliasing rules (gcc 4.1 optimized).

! 2007-12-03 - Markus Frank & Marco Clemencic
 - Implemented the Win32 version of the code in DsoUtils.h, with some
   simplification.

! 2007-11-30 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed DsoUtils.h to work on OSX too.
 - Fix for bug #31677.
   Move GaudiHandles.py from GaudiPython to GaudiKernel.

! 2007-11-28 - Sebastien Binet
 - patch #1560.
   Minor change to avoid possible injection of GaudiKernel.Configurable through
   importOptions.

! 2007-11-26 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed a problem with the dictionary and ROOT >= 5.16.

! 2007-11-21 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed few compilation warnings on osx in the dictionary.

! 2007-11-20 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed few compilation warnings on win32 in the dictionary.

================ GaudiKernel v23r2 ====================================
! 2007-11-16 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added a new incident type (AbortEvent) that force the (Minimal)EventLoopMgr
   to skips all the top algorithms still to be executed for the current event.
   It can be used when a reconstruction step fails so it does not make sense to
   process the event, but we do not want to stop the application.
 - Fixed a bug in the old job option interpretation if mixed with python
   options.
   The sequence:
     MessageSvc.OutputLevel = 1
     #include "SetMsgSvcOutLvlTo2.py"
     MessageSvc.OutputLevel = 1
   was not correctly setting the output level (if SetMsgSvcOutLvlTo2.py sets the
   output level).

! 2007-11-15 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1523.
   Add possibility to have properties of the types std::map<int,int> and
   std::vector<std::pair<int,int> > (the second case is perfectly suited
   for Helder Lopez' request of the list of event/run numbers)
   modified files:
    - GaudiKernel/Parsers.h
      add two functions "parse" for parsing of new types
    - src/Lib/Parse*.cpp
      add the implementation of parsing functions

! 2007-11-14 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added the function GaudiKernel.Configurable.purge to clean up all the
   configurables and the list of already imported files from the memory.
   After a call to "purge" one is able to restart the configuration from scratch
   without having to leave the python session.

! 2007-11-13 - Marco Clemencic
 - Instead of generating *Conf.py files trying to import AthenaCommon and fail
   back on GaudiKernel, use the module GaudiKernel.Proxy, which internally does
   the same kind of trick but only once.

! 2007-11-13 - Sebastien Binet
 - patch #1520 (bug #31097)
   Removed a duplicated data member in ServiceHandle (same information already
   available in the base class).
 - patch #1158
   Modified genconf.exe to generate modules (*_confDb.py) with a smaller memory
   footprint. The code to fill the DB is encapsulated in a function that is then
   deleted after being called.

! 2007-11-12 - Marco Clemencic
 - Moved the *.qmt files to the implicit suite (directory) "gaudikernel.qms".

! 2007-11-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - task #5807.
   Added the header GaudiKernel/SerializeSTL.h to provide implementations of
   operator<< for some common STL containers and GaudiUtils::*Map.
   The implementations live in the namespace GaudiUtils. To use them, one have
   to add "using namespace GaudiUtils" (in the relevant scope).
   Tests have been added too.

! 2007-11-02 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added a temporary work-around for OSX in ProcessDescriptor.cpp.
   To get timing information, it tries to open /proc/$PID/stats, which does not
   exist in OSX. The alternative is to use some other mechanism, but the one
   implemented in ProcessDescriptor seems to cause a segmentation fault.
   (to be investigated)

! 2007-10-31 - Marco Clemencic
 - Rewritten ProcessJobOptions.py. Major changes:
   - honor the #pragma print on/off in old options
   - print a warning if a file is included twice (the second time it is ignored)
   - allow inclusion of ".py" and ".pkl" files from ".opts" files (this is the
     main reason fror the rewrite)
   - moved importOptions from Gaudi.Configaration to ProcessJobOptions to allow
     better recursion

! 2007-10-31 - Marco Clemencic
 - Minor change to the IUpdateManagerSvc interface (added the function :purge")

! 2007-10-29 - Pere Mato
 - KeyedObjectManager.cpp: changed order of specialization and instantiation
   to please gcc 4.0

! 2007-10-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - Use the pattern QMTest and add a .qmt file (QMTest test description) to run
   the DirSearchPath test.
 - Modified DirSearchPath_test to work on Windows too.

! 2007-10-16 - Paolo Calafiura
 - patch #1416. new DirSearchPath method and test
   - Added DirSearchPath::find_all
   - Moved the test from GaudiSvc to GaudiKernel

================ GaudiKernel v23r1 ====================================
! 2007-10-10 - Pere Mato
 - Corrected bug of ProcessJobOptions.py detected by Marco C. when using filenames with
   environments.

! 2007-10-09 - Marco Clemencic
 - Moved DirSearchPath from GaudiSvc/src/JobOptionsSvc to GaudiKernel
   (requested by Paolo Calafiura).
   Note: the 2 tests using DirSearchpath are still in GaudiSvc.

! 2007-10-02 - Pere Mato
 - Patch #1400.
   Support for pickle files in python configurations.
   Fixed various bugs in parsing old joboptions files

! 2007-09-28 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #1345.
   minor modifications to improve Tuples::TupleObj (GaudiAlg package)
   - GaudiKernel/NTuple.h
       1) substitute the explicit specialization for NTuple::Range with
          the regular calls of std::numeric_limits<T>::min()/max()
       2) disable "#ifndef ALLOW_ALL_TYPES"

! 2007-09-26 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1375. Allow configuration of Histogram1D from job options.
   - New class Gaudi::Histo1DDef for histogram description/definition.
   - Implementation of parsing for new histogram properties.
     (Sascha Mazurov)

! 2007-09-25 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #1357.
   Minor improvements to Gaudi::Utils::setProperty():
    - allow to set the documentation of a property
    - allow to set a property from a PopertyType

! 2007-09-24 - Sebastien Binet (& Marco Clemencic)
 - patch #1247. (partial)
   - avoid duplication of symbols in files generated by genconf.
     (Warning: Win32 implementation missing)
   Note: the patch was providing a patched version of genmap which cannot be
         included in Gaudi, but should be proposed to ROOT.

! 2007-09-24 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - changed back Configurables.py into Configurable.py (it was
   a mistake).

! 2007-09-24 - Marco Clemencic
 - modified the way to pass  fallback module to genconf: comma-separated list
   instead of a dedicated option.

! 2007-09-24 - Markus Frank
 - fixed bug #29806. Wrong call to setDataProvider.

! 2007-09-21 - Hubert Degaudenzi & Marco Clemencic
 - factored out the main application part to the Gaudi package.
 - added the GaudiKernel prefix when importing python modules in order
   to avoid local imports.
 - changed the name of Configurable.py into Configurables.py for
   compatibility with the Athena module.
 - added an option to genconf that adds a fallback module for the
   location of Configurables and ConfigurableDb
 - modified the genconfig CMT pattern for the previous change to have
   AthenaCommon by default and if it doesn't exist fall back to
   GaudiKernel. This is a temporary fix until both approaches are merged.

! 2007-08-31 - Hubert Degaudenzi & Paolo Calafiura
 - Patch #1260.moved the MinimalEventLoopMgr from GaudiSvc to GaudiKernel. The factory
   for this service is still in GaudiSvc

! 2007-08-06 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1231.
   - Splitted IChronoStatSvc.h into IChronoSvc and IStatSvc.
   - Remove ICounterSvc::CountObject and replaced it with Stat.
   - Added few free functions to format StatEntity objects as table rows.

! 2007-07-27 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added the file cbrt.h, which provides an implementation of cbrt (cubic
   root) to all the platforms (it is a built-in function of gcc).

! 2007-07-24 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1246.
   Introduced 2 new classes:
     * Gaudi::Guards::ExceptionGuard
       executes a functor in a "standard" try-catch block.
     * Gaudi::Guards::AuditorGuard
       executes a function of an object when the instance is created and
       a second one when destroied, allowing automatic "clean-up" (in case
       of early exit).
   See GaudiKernel/Gaurds.h (doxygen) for more details.

! 2007-07-24 - Charles Leggett
 - patch #1253.
   This patch fixes Algorithm.cpp, AlgTool.cpp and Service.cpp such that
   there is a consistent use of the auditorSvc-after[whatever] in the catch
   loops when an exception is thrown. It also gets rid of some needlessly
   verbose comments.

! 2007-07-24 - Pere Mato
 - patch #1250.
   Removed the default constructor of Service because it is causing a memory
   leak in Reflex.

! 2007-07-24 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1227.
   Added the functions "Gaudi::Utils::setProperty(IInterface*,...)", simpler
   counterparts of "Gaudi::Utils::setProperty(IProperty*,...)".

! 2007-07-23 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1226.
   * SmartIFBase<TYPE>:
     + explicitely disable copy constructor and assignement
     + add "checking operator", operator!()
   * SmartIF<TYPE> and SmartIF<IInterface>
     + add "const" into copy constructor
     + add the constructor from underlying pointer
     + add "const" into standard assignement
     + add "const" into template assignemet
     + remove line duplicates between standard assignement and assignement
       from the regular pointer
     + fix typo in return type of assignement from the base
     + add "checking operator", operator!()

! 2007-07-17 - Sebastien Binet
 - patch #1182.
   Improved precision for timing measurements in ProcessDescriptor
   (on linux).  The patch allow to use the function getrusage when
   possible to get a us precision instead of ms. When getrusage cannot
   be used, the timing is measured in the old way.

! 2007-07-16 - Marco Clemencic
 - changed the syntax for specialization of templated function in namespace
   for gcc 4.1 future use

! 2007-07-16 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - added the possibility to use the universal time for the messages.
   there is a new "%u" format for this. It replaces the usual "%t" in
   the MessageSvc.Format.

! 2007-06-18 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1178.
    * The patch substitute the internal counters, used for
      (I)CounterSvc by generic counters of type StatEntity.
    * This allow to reuse the useful functionality of StatEntity class.
    * In addition it will allow an easy publishing and integration of
      counters with monitoring tasks.
    * Also it adds more functionality for grouping of counters, in
      particular the extraction of the whole group of counters
      (required by Matt Needham)
    * The printout of counters is now coherent with printout of
      generic counters through GuadiCommon<T>.

================ GaudiKernel v23r0 ====================================
! 2007-06-11 - Sebastien Binet
 - Fix to bug #26919. Explicit implementation of the copy constructor
   and assignment operator for the PropertyWithValue class.

! 2007-05-24 - Pere Mato
 - Added specialization of ROOT::Reflex::TypeDistiller for strings in
   AudFactory.h (was missing).

! 2007-05-24 - Marco Clemencic
 - Extended the IIncidentSvc interface to make it possible to register
   a listener for only one occurrence of the requested event
   (see bug #25552).

! 2007-05-24 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1171. The enhancement of existing Algorithm Context Service
   is the primary goal of the proposed patch. The existing
   AlgContextSvc is not safe with respect to e.g. Data-On-Demand
   service or to operations with subalgorithms. The patched service
   essentially implements the queue of executing algorithms, thus the
   problems are eliminiated. In addition the enriched interface
   provides the access to the whole queue of executing algorithms.

! 2007-05-24 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1163. Patch to allow the following syntax:
	 setProperty ( "OutputLevel" , "4" ) ;
	 setProperty ( "OutputLevel" , 4 ) ;  //new
	 setProperty ( "Enable" , "False" ) ;
	 setProperty ( "Enable" , false ) ; //new
	 setProperty ( "ErrorMax" , "10" ) ;
	 setProperty ( "ErrorMax" , 10 ) ; //new
	 std::vector<double> data = ... ; //new
	 setProperty( "Data" , data ) ; //new
	 std::map<std::string,double> cuts = ... ; //new
	 setProperty( "Cuts" , cuts ) ; //new
	 std::map<std::string,std::string> dict = ... ; //new
	 setProperty( "Dictionary" , dict ) ; //new
   The setting of properties through strings is still possible.

! 2007-05-23 - Marco Clemencic
 - patch #1168. Added specialization for void* to GaudiUtils::Hash.

! 2007-05-23 - Charles Leggett
 - patch #1176. Added few missing functions in ITHistSvc
   (already present in THistSvc)

! 2007-05-23 - Vanya Belyaev
 - patch #1161. Improvements and clean-up in StatEntity:
    - Removed "weight"-related functions and methods (unused)
    - Added binomial error calculation for efficiency-like counters
    - Improved print-out format
    - Added methods to make StatEntity mode DIM friendly
    - Some clean up in comments

! 2007-05-23 - Marco Clemencic
 - patch #1160. Changed the returned value of
    - Algorithm::setExecuted()
    - Algorithm::resetExecuted()
    - Algorithm::setFilterPassed()
   from StatusCode to void.

! 2007-05-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - patch #1166. Splitted ParseVectors.cpp in 6 pieces:
    * ParseVectorsBool.cpp
    * ParseVectorsChar.cpp
    * ParseVectorsInteger.cpp
    * ParseVectorsReal.cpp
    * ParseVectorsString.cpp
    * ParseVectorsVector.cpp
   to reduce memory usage at compile time (with a modest increase of
   disk space and compilation time).

! 2007-05-15 - Sebastien Binet
 - patch #1157. Here is a simple patch to harmonize the interaction
   with the underlying m_outputLevel data member of each of these main
   Gaudi components. It makes sure that the 3 of them have:
	int outputLevel () const;
	void initOutputLevel(Property&); //update handler
   also added this method to MsgStream:
	void setMsgSvc( IMessageSvc* svc ) {
	     m_service = svc;
	}

! 2007-05-15 - Chris Jones
 - patch #1136: Updates to Algorithm and AlgTool required for
   changes in GaudiAlg for automatic registration of data to the
   monitoring service
  + Addition of the same declareInfo(...) methods in AlgTool as in
    Algorithm
  + Replace hardcoded monitor service name with new job option
  + New method to provide 'easy' direct access to monitor service
    via pointer

! 2007-05-15 - Sebastien Binet
 - patch #1129: Add the method outputLevel() to Auditor.

! 2007-05-14 - Marco Clemencic
 - fix to bug #25852 bis
   Fixed compilation problem on windows by adding the definitions for
   the missing functions localtime_r and gmtime_r
   (header GaudiKernel/time_r.h).
   Removed also a couple of compilation warnings.

! 2007-05-10 - Ivan Belyaev
 Patch #1126:
 - GaudiKernel/StatEntity.h, src/Lib/StatEntity.cpp
   1) Add the assignment operator from the scalar value according to
      the request by Ulrich Kerzel (LHCb/RICH)
   2) Add two new methods "efficiency" and "efficiencyErr" for
      evaluation of binomial estimate of the efficiency, associated
      with the counter. If the counter could be interpreted as
      efficiency, these methods produce right results. Method
      "efficiency" returns either "flagMean" or -1, if the
      interpretation of counter as efficiency is not possible. In a
      similar way "efficiencyErr" returns the binomial estimate of the
      uncertainty or -1, if the interpretation of counter as
      efficiency is not possible. Note that there could be sizable
      difference between RMS estimate "flagMeanRMS" and the binomial
      estimate "efficiencyErr", however for large statistics and for
      non-extremal (close to ~0 or, especially ~100%) efficiencies,
      these estimates should be very similar.
 - GaudiKernel/ToStream.h
   1) Add the printout for std::list
   2) Add the template parameters for std::vector, std::set, std:map,
      GaudiUtils::Map, GaudiUtils::VectorMap, GaudiUtils::HashMap. It
      allows to use all these function for containers with non-default
      optional template arguments, e.g. allocators, comparison
      criteria, hash functions or underlying containers,
   3) Remove the unused local variable "delim".
 - GaudiKernel/VectorMap.h, GaudiKernel/Map.h. Improve doxygen
   comments according to the request by Marco Cattaneo)

! 2007-05-10 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - fixed warning for gcc 4 (on MacOSX) about non-existing virtual
   destructors in NTuple.h for NTuple::Array, NTuple::Matrix,
   NTuple::Item etc.

! 2007-05-09 - Sebastien Binet
 - patch #1141. Fix return statement of GaudiHandleArray::operator=.

! 2007-05-02 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - fix to bug #25460. The return value of getLastError is now an
   unsigned long. A static_cast was added.

! 2007-04-30 - Andy Salnikov
 - fix to bug #25852. The patch is quite small and touches only two
   classes - Message and MessageSvc. Messages now have one more format
   flag '%t' which is replaced with the formatted timestamp on
   output. Default format string has not changed so default output
   will look identical to what it was before. The format of the
   timestamp can be changed through the additional format string
   similarly to the message format string. Time format can contain
   anything that is accepted by strftime plus additional '%f' code for
   milliseconds.

! 2007-04-27 - Sebastien Binet
 - patch #25888. Fixed uninitialized variable in Algorithm.cpp.

! 2007-04-09 - Marco Clemencic
 - patch #1125. Fixed INamedInterface in order to provide the right
   IInterfaceID. An empty virtual destructor has been added.

! 2007-04-05 - Martin Woudstra
 - Patch #1103. The attached 2 patches (one for GaudiPython and one
   for GaudiKernel) contain the changes needed to support
   ToolHandleArray's (a 'vector' of ToolHandles). This is a new
   feature, and is already in use in ATLAS. In addition to the
   ToolHandleArray and its associated base classes, there is the
   GaudiHandleArrayProperty, and an update to genconf to support it

! 2007-03-25 - Chris Jones
 - Patch #1099. Add Specialization stream operator for
   std::vector<T,A> to MsgStream.h Allows print out of vector created
   with custom allocators e.g. std::vector< RichSmartID,
   boost::pool_allocator< RichSmartID > >

! 2007-04-04 - Chris Jones
 - Patch #1092. There is a bug in the current implementation of the
   format(..) method in MsgStream.(cpp,h) which means if a user uses
   the format method twice in one message request, wrong information
   is printed. The attached patch fixes this by returning instead a
   std::string.  However, if somewere a user is explicitly using the
   returned char * pointer (They really shouldn't be...) a small
   change to their code would be required. i.e.
      char * c = format("XXX,x);
      to
      std::string s = format("XXX,x);
      c = s.c_str();

================ GaudiKernel v22r2 ====================================
! 2007-03-14 - Sebastien Binet
 - Patch #1081 (fix to bug #24704): fix the crash that happens when
   the destinatin file of genconf has a "+" in its path.

! 2007-03-13 - Sebastien Binet
 Patch #1080: fixes to GaudiKernel/src/Util/genconf.cpp:
 - fix handling of templated components
 - fix handling of (default value of) BooleanProperties
 - fix handling of NaN DoubleProperties (follows the good old Garbage
   In, Garbage Out pattern, even though a warning is issued during
   genconf processing...)


! 2007-03-12 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Patch #1073. Simple modification of IExceptionSvc interface (and
   the implementation ExceptionSvc) to avoid the explicit appearence
   of class Algorithm in the interface. The interface is modified to
   substitute Algorithms with INamedInterface. It allows to use the
   service in much wider context, in particular with tools, services
   and auditors.

! 2007-03-9 - Sebastien Binet
 - Patch #1058 (partially). Makes sure a DoubleProperty is understood
   as a double on the python side (and not converted into an int as it
   was the cast)
 - added merge_genconfDb.py scripts to merge configurables.

! 2007-03-9 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - Clean up genconf pattern left over.

! 2007-03-08 - Martin Woudstra
 - patch #1070. The python configurables generated with the current
   genconf.cpp return the python (mangled) class name from the
   function getType(). This should be the C++ class name, otherwise
   the ToolSvc will not find tools from classes in namespaces and/or
   templated classes. This is critical as many classes in ATLAS as of
   these categories and all those are broken now.
 - patch #1071. The GaudiHandle version used in ATLAS has since some
   time an 'empty()' member function to indicate that no component is
   supposed to be retrieved nor used. For some reason this member
   function did not make it into Gaudi 19, so now the ATLAS code is
   broken. patch adds this member function to the GaudiHandleBase
   class, and allows the users to specify an 'empty' handle in the
   constructor (i.e. "" is kept is-as and does not trigger the setting
   to the default type).

! 2007-02-26 - Sebastien Binet
 patch #1041

 Patch #1033
 - patch to genconf which prevents it to segfault when no property
   could be dyn-casted.

! 2007-02-15 - Marco Clemencic
 Patch 1032:
 - Added a helper class to allow the usage of IUpdateManagerSvc from
   python.  The helper class is IUpdateManagerSvc::PythonHelper,
   declared as friend of IUpdateManagerSvc. The implementation
   consists of 2 static functions implemented in dictionary.h.

! 2007-02-14 - Pere Mato
 - Fixed bug #23811: patch #1001 is breaking Configurables generation

! 2007-02-14 - Vanya BELYAEV
 Patch #1001
 - a) couple of fixes, which allows to retrieve the private tools not
      only from Algorithm, Services and AlgTools, but also from
      Auditors.
   b) Update the queryInteface method for AlgTool,Algorithm,Auditor
      and Servicebase classes to allow query for INamedInterface, in
      addition "C-cast" is substituted with "static_cast"
   The modified files:
       src/Lib/AlgTool.cpp
       src/Lib/Algorithm.cpp
       src/Lib/Auditor.cpp
       src/Lib/Service.cpp

! 2007-02-13 - Pere Mato
 - Reverted change in Booststrap.cpp. This fixes "bug #23684: BootSvcLocator is breaking athena.py"
 - genconf.cpp: applied "patch #1016: configurable genconf"
                fixed "bug #23649: ICounterSvc inheritance tree and Reflex::PluginSvc"

! 2007-02-08 - Pere Mato (David Quarrie)
 - Bootstrap.cpp:
   Introduced a dual-stage boostrap mechanism to ensure an orderly startup
   of the ApplicationMgr. If the Gaudi::svcLocator() function is called before the singleton
   ApplicationMgr instance exists, a BootSvcLocator singleton instance is
   created. This responds to any subsequent requests for services by
   returning StatusCode::FAILURE, unless the ApplicationMgr singleton
   instance has been created in the interim. In this case, the BootSvcLocator
   forwards the request to the ApplicationMgr instance. The motiviation for
   this is to handle static object instances where the constructor attempts
   to locate services and would otherwise instantiate the ApplicationMgr
   instance in an unorderly manner. This logic requires that the
   ApplicationMgr instance is created explicitly.

! 2007-02-05 - Paolo Calafiura
 Patch #1007
 - turned the templated member functions operator << (T&) and its
   partial spec operator << (vector<T>&) into open functions. This
   appears to remove ambiguities a user defined MsgStream operator <<
   template (typically in a data object header file). The compiler
   sees the user defined template as a better specialization and
   matches that with no ambiguity.
 - removed the MsgStream& operator(std::ostream&) recently proposed as
   a patch since it does not serve any useful purpose

! 2007-01-31 - Pere Mato
 - Applied patch #1000: improvement in ConfigurableDb output for genconf

! 2007-01-30 - Pere Mato (
 - Applied [partially] patch #997: genconf.cpp patch
 - It adds to genconf.cpp:
      - a "double loading" libraries to shield against dual_use
        libraries (which could bring lots of external
       libraries into the generated  Configurable)
      - the generation of an ASCII file (a-la-rootmap) to describe
        Configurables for the benefit of the (athena)
        PropertyProxy.py.

 - this is the beginning of the release notes for the merge with the
   v20r13 release (v20r9b branch).

! 2006-11-26 - Vanya BELYAEV - patch #922
 - GaudiKernel/VectorMap.h
    1) On the request form ATLAS (Savannah reports  #21395 and #21394)
       add the method "update" to class GaudiUtils::VectorMap.
       NOTE: It is nor STL-compliant!
       It behaves like "insert", but it OVERRIDES the mapped value
    2) Also  "const-look-up" is added through the methods
       "operator()" and "operator[]"
       Again it is nto STL-complient signature:
       the methdod are "const" , and there are no
       "non-const" analogues

     *  For typical usage of this class in LHCb context
     *  as "ExtraInfo" field I would like to recommend
     *  to AVOID this method

    3) Add also the checked access in STL-spirit:
        GaudiUtils::VectorMap::at
       throw std::out_of_range exception for non-existing keys
 - GaudiKernel/ToStream.h
    add the partial specialization for printout of following classes:
     1) GaudiUtils::Map
     2) GaudiUtils::HashMap
     3) GaudiUtils::VectorMap
    The printout done in a style of "Python-dictionary", similar to
     std::map
    Also print out for std::set is added
 - src/Lib/VectorMap.cpp
     new file fith implementtation of action for nonexisting key

! 2006-11-22 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - added environment variable GCCXML_CXXFLAGS=" -m32" for 32 bits
   compilation on amd64 machines (with the slc4-ia32 tag)
 - added environment variable GAUDIEXE which points to the Gaudi
   executable.

! 2006-11-02 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - modified rootmapdump.py in order to match any file *beginning* with
   "rootmap" and not only the "rootmap" filename. This is the same
   matching behavior as the one in ROOT itself.

! 2006-10-27 - Ivan Belyaev
 - patch #870. Added operator << for StatusCode.

! 2006-10-26 - Marco Clemencic
 - Patch #736. Improvemts to TransientFastContainer. Now it allows to
   use for new objects the default constructor, the copy constructor
   and a user specified constructor (via placement new).

! 2006-10-12 - Marco Clemencic
 - Patch #879. Fixed a bug in DataSvc. When retrieving an object from
   the transient store, it fails if the root node has not yet been
   loaded. I added a check on the root node for those cases and I
   explicitely load it if needed.

 - Patch #863. Add the function System::setEnv to set an environment
   variable.  Setting the variable to "" results in removing it from
   the environment (same behavior on windows and linux). The parameter
   overwrite define the behavior in the case the variable is alredy
   present (0=no change, 1=overwrite).

! 2006-11-29 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - this is the end of the release notes for the merge with the
   v20r13 release (v20r9b branch).

! 2006-11-27 - David Quarrie
 - fixed compilation problems for MacOS 10.4

! 2006-11-17 - Pere Mato
 - ISvcLocator.h: Added new function eraseService() to erase a service
   from the list of known services
 - Service.cpp: The destructor calls eraseService() to cleanup the
   service list
 - Minor corrections for StatusCode.

! 2006-11-10 - Markus Frank -Patch #908
 - Removed access to histogram factory.
 - Added storage types for online usage to CLID.h
 - new header HistogramBase.h to allow access to ROOT implementation
   of AIDA histograms.

! 2006-11-09 - Pere Mato
 - Added classes JobHistory, AlgorithmHistory, AlgToolHistory,
   DataHistory, ServiceHistory from "GaudiHistory" package such that
   it can be removed. The goal is to have less packages
   (i.e. complexity)
 - requirements: added pattern to generate Python configuration file
 - genconf.cpp: adapted to new properties

================ GaudiKernel v21r0 ====================================
! 2006-10-31 - Pere Mato
 - StatusCode.h(.cpp) - Reworked to avoid copying complicated objects
   all the time

! 2006-09-25 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - added the scripts folder with the rootmapdump.py utility. This
   scripts allows to dump the ROOTMAPs present in the
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH. It can also check the duplication of entries.

! 2006-09-21 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - factored out the stacktrace function from the StatusCode class to the
   System.cpp file.

! 2006-09-09 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - added dictionary generation for ExceptionSvc, IssueLogger,
   StatusCodeSvc, THistSvc.
 - fixed compilation problem for win32 in the StatusCode.cpp file.

! 2006-09-09 - Charles Leggett & Hubert Degaudenzi
 - Imported new services interfaces from ATLAS: IExceptionSvc,
   IIssueLogger, IStatusCodeSvc, ITHistSvc.
 - StatusCode.h has been modified (and has now an implementation)
 - new IssueSeverity.cpp.

! 2006-09-09 - Vanya BELYAEV - patch #839
 - GaudiKernel/Grammars.h
     Add a method StringGrammar::matchString, which allows to
     substitute all "std::isspace" symbols with the blank.
     It is a bit incorrect operation, but it allows
     to split very long string into few lines.
     It is incorrect since the overall number of blank symbols
     in the string is a quantity which is difficult to control.
     One still needs to be very careful with CR/LF symbols in the
     opts-files.
     This particular fix solves the problem with configuration
     of DataOnDemandSvc, where long string are unavoidable.
     The solution  ( 'std::isspace' --> ' ' ) has been discussed with
     Marco Cattaneo. We have agreed that this solution is not safe,
     but it solves the particular problem.

     The fix is kindly provided by Sasha Mazurov (Alexander.Mazurov@gmail.com)

 - GaudiKernel/Property.h
    1) reshuffle the property assignment/load methods to eliminate the
       duplication of actions, from now Property::load is implemented
       through Property::assign. It provides a bit more coherency in
       the code.
    2) the actual action for Property::assign and Property::load is
       been released a bit, not one can load/assign either from the
       property of the same type or from the valid string representation
       of property of any type. Previously only StringProperty has been
       allowed.
    3) The full template specializations of
       PropertyWithValue<std::string>::toString and
       PropertyWithValue<std::string>::assign are provided
        - there are no "extra" confusing double quotes now in the
          string printout
        - the string is always parsed at assign, in particular it means
          that all surrounding pairs of quotes will be removed
          automatically as redundant
 - GaudiKernel/ToStream.h
      - modify a bit the implementation of Gaudi::Utils::toStream
        for std::string to use single quotes if the string containt
        double quotes
      - add the implementation of Gaudi::Utils::toStream for boolean values
        to print boolean values "à la Python" as "True" or "False"
      - add the implementation for float/double/long double to print them
        with reasonable precision. It is important since the default
        precision of ios_base is 6, which could be not enough, and
        the precision of boost::lexical_cast is
         std::numerical_limit<...>::digit10+1,
        which is much more than we need.
  - GaudiKernel/Property.h, src/Lib/Property.cpp
     add few useful functions to descrease the number of ugly
     technical lines in some public code

     namespace Gaudi { namespace Utils {
       bool      hasProperty ( const IProperty*  p  , const std::string& name ) ;
       bool      hasProperty ( const IInterface* p  , const std::string& name ) ;
       Property* getProperty ( const IProperty*  p  , const std::string& name ) ;
       Property* getProperty ( const IInterface* p  , const std::string& name ) ;
       bool      hasProperty
       ( const std::vector<const Property*> , const std::string& name ) ;
       const Property* getProperty
       ( const std::vector<const Property*> , const std::string& name ) ;

     }}

================ GaudiKernel v20r9 ====================================
! 2006-08-21 - Ivan Belyaev
 - patch #817. For new associatiove properties, e.g. map
   the implemented behaviour do not fulfill the naive expectations. E.g:

   A.a = { "a" : 1 , "a" : 2 , "b" : 3 , "a" : 10 } ;
   A.a += { "a" : 100 , "a" : 200 };

   The result will be the map:

   { "a" : 1 , "b" = 2 } ; // "The first wins"

   this result is not in agreement with "naive" expectation for
   std::map, where "the last wins". the attached patch solves the
   problem, and now the behaviour of the properties is more coherent
   with behaviour of std::map.

! 2006-08-06 - Markus Frank
 - System.cpp: do not free strings after calls to strerror() or
   dlerror().  This is known to cause valgrind errors because libc
   internally allocates memory, but is the **correct** usage of these
   functions according to the docs. Otherwise repeated calls tend to
   screw up malloc.

! 2006-07-31 - Pere Mato
 - Changed interface IJobOptionsSvc from pointer to reference to fix
   bug #18581 overview: Memory leak due to changed behaviour of
   JobOptionsSvc

================ GaudiKernel v20r8 ====================================

   class in the xml selection file.

! 2006-07-07 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - bug #17843: fixed extra semicolon and DOS end of lines.

! 2006-07-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - patch #748: fixed the recipient of the std::string::find method. It
   should not be assigned to int but to std::string::size_type since
   it has a different size on 64 bits plateforms.

! 2006-06-26 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - bug #17739. Changed the return value of GaudiMain. Before it was always
   returning 0 and now it returns the StatusCode of the ApplicationMgr
   in the UNIX command line way.
      - "0" for success
      - "1" for failure
   to test it for examples one could do:
     >Gaudi.exe some.opts && echo "Gaudi has succeeded"

! 2006-06-15 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - Fix gcc 3.4.5 compilation problems in the new property parser.

! 2006-06-06 - Alexander Mazurov & Ivan Belyaev
 - new property parser installed. It relies on the Boost::spirit
   lexer/parser.

   TransientFastContainer when it is called with an argument different
   from 0.

================ GaudiKernel v20r7 ====================================
! 2006-05-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - patch #727. Fixed a compilation problem on Win32 after using
   std::map instead of hash_map in GaudiUtils::HashMap.

! 2006-05-19 - Marco Clemencic
 - patch #725. Fixed a warning on Win32.

! 2006-05-11 - Marco Cattaneo
 - patch #723. Redefines the unit "pascal" to "Pa" to avoid a name
   clash that causes a compiler warning on on Windows in
   SystemOfUnits.h

! 2006-05-11 - Vanya Belyaev
 - added templated SmartRefVector constructor with first and last
   iterator pointers as arguments

================ GaudiKernel v20r6 ====================================
! 2006-05-04 Marco Clemencic
 - patch #720. Added TransientFastContiner<T> (and related helper classes
   TransientFastContainerBase and DefaultObjectCleaner<T>).
   The new container does its own memory management, recycling the objects not
   used and not deleting them when it is cleared (just reset an internal
   counter).

! 2006-05-02 Hubert Degaudenzi
 - Added PhysicalConstants.h and SystemOfUnits.h (from CLHEP) in
   GaudiKernel. The constants and units are in the Gaudi::Units
   namespace.
 - patch #715. Added boost allocator wrapper (Marco Clemencic).
 - patch #719. Added 2 functions to make the UpdateManagerSvc work
   safely in multi-thread environment. They allow to block the
   activities of the service while interacting with it (Marco Clemencic).

! 2006-04-20 Hubert Degaudenzi
 - clean up of the legacy lines of code for obsolete compiler version
  (before gcc 3).

! 2006-04-20 Marco Clemencic
 - patch #705. The default hash functions is extremely expensive for
   integers. This causes extremely poor performaces for the standard
   KeyedContainer<>. The patch introduces efficient specializations of
   Hash<> for int, long and long long (and unsigned).

! 2006-04-13 Charles Leggett and Hubert Degaudenzi
 - inserted ATLAS feature INamedInterface.

================ GaudiKernel v20r5 ====================================
! 2006-03-15
 - modified the returned values of the Auditors
   beforeExecute/afterExecute (etc) to be void instead of StatusCode::SUCCESS.

! 2006-03-09 Markus Frank
 - patch #691. Add support for objects in N-tuples. Note: This only works for
   NTuple::Item.  NTuple::Array and NTuple::Matrix is __NOT__
   supported for objects. If you need this functionality store an
   std::vector<Object*>. See GaudiExamples/POOLIO/EvtCollectionWrite
   for an example of the usage.
 - Added GaudiMain.cpp in the library.

! 2006-03-09 Markus Frank
 - patch #668. Fix retrieval of error string in System::getErrorString().
   The routine caused a core dump on linux when dl_error() returned NULL.

! 2006-02-24 Marco Clemencic
 - patch #678. It has been reported that MS implementation of hash_map
   is extremely slow. The idea is to use std::map instead (which is
   faster than hash_map on win!!!), while we investigate to find a
   better solution.

! 2006-02-23 Hubert Degaudenzi
 - fix compilation warnings with Gcc 3.4.4

! 2006-02-14 Ivan Belyaev
 - added new allocator imported from GEANT4. They should decrease the
   allocation time significantly. Please have a look at the
   GaudiExample "Allocator".

! 2006-02-06 Hubert Degaudenzi
 - fixed windows compilation warning (bug #14852).

! 2006-01-12 Pere Mato
 - Added std::vector<const ContainedObect*> in the dictionary

! 2006-01-10 Hubert Degaudenzi
 - moved the macro definitions DECLARE_XXX_FACTORY and
   DECLARE_NAMESPACE_XXX_FACTORY from DeclareFactoryEntries.h to their
   own header files where XXX are Algorithm, Auditor, Converter,
   Object, Service, Tool.
 - corrected wrong syntax in macros.
 - moved the remaining macros (DECLARE_XXX and DECLARE_NAMESPACE_XXX)
   from DeclareFactoryEntries.h to their corresponding header files.

! 2005-12-20 Hubert Degaudenzi
 - Commented out AIDATupleSvc.

! 2005-12-20 Marco Clemencic
 - Added UpdateManager interface.

! 2005-12-05  Manuel Domenech

   a preselection criteria for reading data from a tuple.

! 2005-11-15 Markus Frank
 - Fix problems of KeyedContainer when using keys with explicit constructors.

================ GaudiKernel v20r2 ====================================
! 2005-11-22 Pere Mato
 - Booststrap.h: converted Gaudi class into a Gaudi namespace

! 2005-11-22 Vanya Belyaev
 - Added class GaudiUtils::VectorMap (former _VctMap from Vanya) that implements associative version inspirer
   from the Loki library by Andrei Alexandrescu.

 an associative vector
   inspired from Loki associative vector.
   Fix problems of KeyedContainer when using keys with explicit constructors.

! 2005-11-21 Markus Frank
 - Fix problems of KeyedContainer when using keys with explicit constructors.

! 2005-11-21 -  Pere Mato
  - Added new methods in IAlgorithm: isInitialized(), isFinalized() and isExecuted() (suggested by Vanya)

! 2005-11-18 -  Marco Clemencic
  - Added 3 classes to replace the HashTable and the hacks in stl_hash.h

    * GaudiUtils::Map is a simple associative container. It is implemented as a proxy
      to a template class implementing the underlying container (defaulting to std::map).
      It features "operator[](key) const" and "operator()(key) const". It has a virtual
      destructor so that it can be extended via inheritance.
    * GaudiUtils::Hash is a simple hash function (based on Stroustrup's example) which
      correctly handle pointers, std::string and char*. It is portable between Linux and Windows.
    * GaudiYUtils::HashMap is a Map which uses internally a hash_map. The differences
      between gcc and VC7 are taken into account in order avoid users having to put "#ifdef"s.

! 2005-11-09 - Chris Jones
 - Change output level data member in Algorithms and AlgTools from int
   to IntegerProperty, and add a non-const access method for this
   property. Allows uses to attach callback handle methods to this
   property (Such as in GaudiAlg) to allow them to react as needed
   to changes in the output levels. Needed in GaudiAlg to force the
   creation of a new cached MsgStream object.

================ GaudiKernel v20r1 ====================================
! 2005-11-03 Pere Mato
 - added the changes to dictionary.xml delection file. Removed the dictionary_rflx.xml file.

   KeyedObject in the dictionary_rflx.xml selection file (Markus Frank).

================ GaudiKernel v20r0 ====================================
! 2005-09-12  Pere Mato
 - MsgStream.h: removed special stream function for StatusCode. It did
   not help on WIN32
 - GaudiException.h: added explicit call to accessor of StatusCode to
   unsigned long code

! 2005-08-05  Hubert Degaudenzi
 - added "long long" format in the instantiation of SimpleProperty and
   SimplePropertyRef templates.

! 2005-08-05  Hubert Degaudenzi
 - applied patch #502. Minor polishing of Stat and StatEntity classes
   to improve their functionality (in absolutely backward compatible
   way). From now the usage of StatEntyty in 'standalone' mode is
   greatly simplified (previously it has been tightly coupled to
   Chrono&Stat Service, and "public" interface was ugly). The
   functionality of Stat class is also improved (Vanya).

! 2005-07-25 - Hubert Degaudenzi
 - fixed bug #9475. Missing #include <stdexcept> (Mattias Ellert).

! 2005-07-25 - Hubert Degaudenzi

   gccxml inputs in new subdirectory dict
   output id a dictionary DLL called "GaudiKernelDict"
   Reflex dictionary produced in parallel: "GaudiKernelRflxDict"
 - Fix inline bug in SmartDataPtr (function was never instantiated,
   hence problem did not appear)
 - Fix data member access in RndmGenerators.h

! 2005-07-21 Hubert Degaudenzi
 - patch #476. Compilation of some Reflex dictionaries currently
   fails. I'd need an overload for the MsgStream::operator << for
   StatusCode to cure this. The attached patch is one proposal how it
   could be done (Stefan Roiser).

! 2005-07-18  Hubert Degaudenzi
 - fixed bug #9466. extra semicolon (Mattias Ellert).

! 2005-07-15  Hubert Degaudenzi  <Hubert.Degaudenzi@cern.ch>

! 2005-02-11 - Pere Mato
 - Algorithm.cpp: removed the name extensions such as  ".sysInitialize()", ".sysExecute()"
   and ".sysFinalize()" in the messages generated by the base class.
   It makes it simple to control over the threshold messages from algorithm. (suggested by Vanya)

! 2005-02-02 - Pere Mato

! 2004-12-06 - Markus Frank
 - SealDictionary.h
   Make use of ReflectionBuilder/CollectionProxy.h
   for new container handling using ROOT CollectionProxy mechanism.
 - Service.cpp:
   Inhibit printing of services before the properties are properly
   set. Until the properties are set, each service inherits the
   output level of the message service.
   This was apparently screwed with the invention of the
   OutputLevel update handler for services.
   This removes the "ignored" global printout level of the
   sub-eventselector instances when opening new files.

                  more than once.
 - Service.cpp: added protection on accessor msgSvc() for the MessageSvc itself.
 - Changed IAlgManager interface.
   - Added initializeAlgorithms() and finalizeAlgorithms()

   Files are moved from GaudiSvc package to allow run-time
   public inspection of Chrono & Stat counters
 - GaudiKernel/IChronostatSvc.h
   Two method are added to allow run-time publc inspection of
   Chrono & Stat counters:
     const ChronoEntity* chrono ( const ChronoTag& tag ) const ;

================GaudiKernel v16r1=====================================
! 2004-07-22 - Pere Mato
  - DataObject.h: Added ostream operator << . In this way we can output DataObjects using ostream or MsgStream. This was
                  already possible with ContainedObjects.
! 2004-07-20 - Pere Mato
  - KeyedDictionary.h: Reverted typo removal in KeyedContainer<> class name. Otherwise the existing files are not
    readable.
  - Incicent.h: Added doxygen comments (from Chris Jones)
  - Property.h/MsgStream.h: added more specialized templates for handling MsgStream operator << and
    stream operator << for ArrayProperties and vector<T>. This should avoid compilation errors
    detected by Marco.

! 2004-07-19 - Pere Mato

  Changes in interfaces needed for improved interactivity support :
  IService.h   : Added new method reinitialize() to allow services to
                 take into account changes after the first time initialization
  IAlgorithm.h : Added beginRun() and endRun() methods. These are called each time
                 the event loop is executed.
  IEventProcessor.h : Added executeRun() and nextEvent() methods. This is to
                      eliminate the need to use the IAppMgrUI interface in the
                      EventLoopMgr components.
  IAppMgrUI.h  : Renamed method state() to stateName().
  IScriptingSvc.h : Deleted

! 20010627 - Markus Frank
  Bootstrap.h/cpp : Allow to set the instance of the service locator
                    in case several ApplicationMgr instances are present.
  ObjectVector.h,
  ObjectList.h    : Add forward typedefs for pointer and const_pointer
                    (Requested by P.Calafiura/LBL)
  RefTable.h      : Implement serialize methods
  RegistryEntry.h/cpp,
  DataSvc.h/cpp   : Implement several bug-fixes
                     - allow for objects in locations like /AA/BB/BB/BB/...
                     - allow to access objects with omission of the root
                       directory: "/Event/MC" is equivalent to "MC"
                     - execution optimization
  SmartDataObjectPtr.h : Fix annoying compiler warning
  SmartRefBase.h,
  SmartRef.h      : operator==() was badly implemented (Found by O.Callot)
  strcasecmp.h    : WIN32 needs an additional #include <cstring>

! 20010625 - Pere Mato
  - Added remote properties functionality. Changed PropertyMgr and base classes Service
    and Algorithm
  - Added MsgStream::endmsg with same functionality as endreq. (Request from ATLAS)
  - Using AIDA Historams instead of LHCb private ones. The existing include files
    include the new ones but generating a warning. The IAnnotation interface is added
    because it does not exists in the used AIDA release


! 20010618 - v10 (Flr)
  requirements - use GaudiPolicy v5
                 apply pattern package_stamps

! 20010508 - Pere Mato
  Fixed bug reported by M. Cattaneo. The OutputLevel of AlgTools was not
  set correctly if the parent Algorithm didn't set it explicitely.

! 20010503 - Markus Frank
  Allow access to data store items without specification of the top level
  directory. It is equivalent to specify an histogram like "/stat/simple/1"
  or simply "simple/1". Note that the the entire prefix "/stat/" must be
  omitted. The use is backwards compatible.
  Added a qualifier ALWAYS to the message service specifying that a given
  message should always be printed.
  ie.
  MsgStream log (msgSvc(), "Name")
  log << MSG::ALWAYS << "Hello." << endreq;
  will result in
  Name      SUCCESS Hello.
  and will not be omitted.

! 20010430 - Markus Frank
  Bug fixes:
  GaudiKernel/DllMain.icpp WINNT: Processhandle should no longer be closed
                           since the handle is shared for all DLLs.
  GaudiKernel/INTuple.h    Interface extended to directly use NTuple pointer
                           to write/read n-tuple. It is no longer necessary to
                           use the n-tuple service for these actions.

                                    had bad type. Now this check checks for the
                                    presence of the object AND the data type.
                                    Moved pointer to object from SmartDataObjectPtr
                                    to SmartDataStorePtr (template class).
                                    Also moved corresponding check operators.

 -@System:
       Major code reshuffeling.
        - Static class was changed to namespace. This will make it much simpler to
        extend the functionality without actually having the default header System.h.
        System.h containes the declarations of all functions in a backwards-compatible way.
      - All other functionality was factorized out:
        Memory.h/cpp 		Info about memory consumption
        Timing.h/cpp   		Info about time consumption
        ModuleInfo.h/cpp	Info about running modules
	Debugger.h/cpp          Invoke debugger from running program (NT only)
        ProcessDescriptor.h/cpp **Internal** access to process specific information
        + Win32Api.h            as it is exported by Linux/NT. This header is PURELY internal
                                and should never be included directly.

! 20010313 Pere Mato
 - Moved files ISolid.h, IPVolume.h, ILVolume.h, IDetectorElement.h, IGeometryInfo.h
   ITransportSvc.h to the DesDesc package. Forward links to the new position have been
   left in place.

! 20010312 Markus Frank
 Changes to the job options processing
 - implemented PropertyMgr::setProperty( const std::string& n, const std::string& v )
 - Properly implement the macro QUOTEDELEMENTINPUT.
   CTDay ir right when he quotes that this is "HACK Big Time". It's also undebuggable.

! 20010305 Pere Mato
 - Corrected bug reported by O. Callot that the OutputLevel was not working
   for Algorithms.

! 20010228 David Quarrie
 - ARM page 210 tweaks to IToolFactory.h to avoid compiler warnings. Add
   DECLARE_ALGTOOL(X) and DECLARE_TOOL(X) macros to DeclareFactoryEntries.h

! 20010226 Pere Mato
 - Small changes to make it compile in NT

! 20010223 David Quarrie
 - Changes for Solaris support, which is incomplete. The package compiles on
   this platform, but some of the required template specialization "hacks" are
   not fully understood and need to be revisited. Run-time debugging hasn't
   yet begun.
 - Changes to avoid compiler warning messages. These are all due to function
   overloading across class hierarchies. The policy is described on Page 210
   of the ARM. It's not yet clear whether these are compatible with the Visual
   C++ compiler on NT. Modified files:
       GenericLink.h IAlgFactory.h IAuditorFactory.h IDataDirectory.h
       IFactory.h IHistogramSvc.h ISvcFactory.h ObjectContainerBase.h
       ObjectFactory.h ObjectList.h ObjectVector.h
 - Changes to support the scripting service. SimpleProperties now support
   callback handlers for both reading and updating. The IProperty interface
   has been extended to allow more flexible setting & retrieving of properties
   from streams and strings. Modified files:
       IProperty.h Property PropertyMgr PropertyVerifier
 - Add support for explicitly specifying the CLID and name of the root
   object in the transient event store (defaults are CLID_Event and "/Event").
   Modified files:
    DataSvc IDataManagerSvc
 - Other details:
   AlgTool Algorithm Auditor Service
       Support new IProperty interface. Use function template for
       declareProperty. Support deferred service instantiation in service
       accessors.
   FactoryTable.h
        Fix compiler warning because of missing comment characters
   System.cpp
        Minor tweak to avoid SOlaris compiler warning.

   converters in Linux.
 - Corrected bug in Algorithm::service()
 - In Bootstrap.h, added static method Gaudi::svcLocator() to get the ISvcLocator*
   in isolation.
 - In ISvcLocation.h added a templated method ISvcLocator::service() to facilitate
   retrival of services.

! 20010122 - GaudiKernel v8r1 and head revision (Flr)
  GaudiKernel/IGiGa*.h - update include file path to new schema.

! 20000119 Pere Mato
 <<< Changes are not compatible with existing packages. Everything should be re-built >>>>
 - Eliminated static library GaudiBase.
 - Eliminated the constant data files IInterface.cpp and Kernel.cpp
 - Renamed class IID to InterfaceID
 - Added de definition of the InterfaceID (IID) constants in each interface Ixxxx.h file
 - Introduced new file ClassID.h which constains some the definition of CLID and some basic
   constants.
 - Changes asked by Vanya for the classes: ILVolume, IPVolume, ISolid, IGeometryInfo,
   IDetectorElement

! 20001215 Pere Mato
 - Renamed Time::Time class by TimePoint class
 - The constants Time::time_absolutepast and Time::time_absolutefutre are now defined
   in the TimePoint.h. The namespace Time has been removed.

! 20001213 Pere Mato
 - Cleanup and adaptation to the new way of documenting the code based
   on Doxygen (JavaDoc style)
 - Incorparated changes done by D.Quarrie in the old LHCb repository

 - Add isInitialized() and seInitialized() member functions and handling to prevent
   multiple initialization attempts on the same Algorithm. This protection is needed
   when scripting is in use.

! 20001119 - David Quarrie
 - Implemented a new service called ScriptingSvc. This is a service (with an
   initial implementation based on Python), which provides a scripting capability
   at run-time as opposed to the JobOptionsSvc which is limited to run startup
   time. This service has entailed some changes to the Gaudi kernel classes, which
   are mainly extensions to existing interfaces, but with some backwards-compatible
   rework of several of the Property classes.
   + Added new interface: IScriptingSvc

- Auditor/Auditor
  Same changes as for Algorithm.

- Interfaces/IServiceLocator
  Add list<IService*> getServices() for symmetry with the IAlgManager.

- JobOptionsSvc
  A major rework of the Property class hierarchy to better support the scripting
  interface. For the most part the changes are backwards compatible, with the
  exception that bounds checking involves use of a verifier().  Note that the
  PropertyRef.cpp & .h files are obsolete since that class is now typedef'd.
  The PropertyList class for nested properties is not yet functional. Both of
  these classes have been retained but bypassed in the build for now.

- Kernel/Service
  Replace overloaded declareProperty function by function template.
  Add PropertyMgr* accessor

- ApplicationMgr/AppMgrUI
  Add AppMgrUI class as intermediate class between IAppMgrUI and
  ApplicationMgr. This simplifies the scripting interface.


! 20001204 Pere Mato
  Moved in ObjectVector<T> and ObjectList<T> from the LHCbEvent package.
  Removed iterator from ObjectContainerBase class

! 20001122 Pere Mato

  move *.h, *.icpp and GaudiFactory.cpp into GaudiKernel/
  update #include statements

!=============================================================================
! 20001018 - Pere Mato
 - Implemented a new service called IncidentSvc. This allows to communicate
   asynchronously things that happen in the system. The ApplicationMgr uses it to inform
   when begining and ending the processing of one physics event.
   + Added new interfaces related to the new service: IIncidentSvc.h, IIncidentListener.h
   + Added new base class: Incident.h

 - Changed IHistogramSvc to be consistent with the (HTL) histogram implementation using
   double for defining histogram edges instead of float. Code using histograms needs to
   be re-compiled!!. (CT0000000035488)

    limit to allow continuation of trhe program. Default is one.
    Added accessor to RndmGenSvc from base class.

! 20000615 - (Pere Mato, David Quarrie)
  - Changed interface IAlgorithm and base class Algorithm to support
    Algorithm sequences (Babar style). Added some more algorithm flags
   (enabled, executed, fileter passed, ...) in base class. Added method
    reasetExecuted() in the IAlgorithm interface.
  - Changed IProperty interface to support property browsing. Added the
    following methods:
    const Property& getProperty( const std::string& name ) const = 0;
    const std::vector<Property*>& getProperties( ) const = 0;
  - Changed base class Property to introduce the possibility of asking
    to a property for its type.
  - Introduced new classes: PropertyList, CommandProperty
    A PropertyList is a Property that contains an array of other properties
    A CommandProperty has a callback function associated that is called
    when a new value of the property is set.
    The PropertyList can handle property nesting. The name convention is
    that names are separated by ":".
  - Changed PropertyMgr to base its implementation with PropertyList

! 20000609 - (Markus Frank)
  - Main improvement:
    Implementation of the public part of the random number generator package.

  Besides this I **had** to do some code cleanup:
  - Algorithm.h: Removed Algorithm::create(...)
    Function was declared but never implemented.
  - IChronoStatSvc.h: "long double" is not really a ansi data type.
    Changed to double.
  - IDataManagerSvc.h
    IID_IDataManagerSvc_NO_ERROR = SUCCESS becomes
    IID_IDataManagerSvc_NO_ERROR = IInterface::SUCCESS
  - ITime.h: use longlong data type from kernel.h instead
    of __int64 and "long long" + #ifdef.
  - PropertyRef.h: Simple typedefs of simple properties.
    e.g. typedef SimplePropertyRef<int> IntegerPropertyRef;
    just as it is done in "Property.h".
  - DataObject.cpp: Actually implement 2 member functions which
    were always in the header, but never made it to code.
  - Kernel.h: If neither Linux nor WIN32 is the platform,
    fix "longlong" to a 64 bit structure capable of holding
    the variable.
  - StreamBuffer.h: Clean up internal classes ContainedLink and
    IdentifiedLink, get rid of macros
  - Message.h: There is no such class "ostream". Use #include <iostream> instead;
  - MsgStream.h: Added copy constructor
  - NTuple.h:    Get rid of a few macros and write the proper code instead.
  - Get rid of NTupleFile.h and NTupleDirectory.h - should never have
    been used at all. The classes were always defined in NTuple.h!


! 20000525

- Fixed template instantiation in Ntuple::Item (For version 6 of Visual C++
