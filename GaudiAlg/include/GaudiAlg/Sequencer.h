/**
 ** ClassName: Sequencer
 **
 ** Description: A Sequencer is essentially a list of Algorithms and is responsible
 **              for their management. Note that Sequences may themselves contain other
 **              Sequences. The default execute() implementation loops over the
 **              members of the sequence, calling their execute() methods. However, this
 **              can be modified if a member is disabled, has already been executed, or a
 **              member indicates that it's filter fails. The the former two cases the
 **             execution of the member is bypassed. In the latter case, the loop is
 **             terminated and the Sequencer assumes the same filtered state as the
 **             last member.
